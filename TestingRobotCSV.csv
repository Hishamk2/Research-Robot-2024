5611290,Is it a good idea to use a single-board-computer in a UAV robot?,|robotics|,"<p>I'm not sure it's good or bad, the robot should have computer vision for SLAM. What's your idea?</p>

Has anyone done an API for it in .Net? Once again, a case of trying to not reinvent the wheel...</p>

<p>I did find <a href=""http://python-poly.blogspot.com/2011/01/in-beginning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> about controlling it in Python, but I wanted to check if anyone had done a .Net version before I began chasing down the pipe.</p>

5702225,A simple robot simulator which has automatic IR scanning for coordinates and simple state mapping,|simulator|robot|path-finding|a-star|infrared|,"<p>I am currently doing a project for a post-grad agents paper. For my project I have an idea about extending anytime searches such as ARA* ADA* and DLite*. I want to test this idea by simulating it on a robot. I've been looking at different software for the past few nights and have had no luck. </p>

<p>Ultimately I need something that has a robot which will have the following information available at all times and in a discrete fashion:</p>

<p>Coordinates (x,y,z) 
Velocity</p>

<p>I also need the robot to have some way of gathering coordinates from its environment, such as having an IR scanner which will map x,y coordinates with (passable/impassible).</p>

<p>Finally I'll need to be able to program in algorithms which will use the environment information in order to suggest which states to pass through in its path to a goal coordinate.</p>

<p>My question is whether or not there is software which I can achieve all of this without too much effort. I wouldn't want to spend more than 7 nights programming this and Ideally I would like to have some visible results within a night or two.</p>

<p>I have programmed a lot of heuristic search algorithms for my dissertation (i.e. Perimeter search, BiMaxf, BS*, A*, my own bidirectional search algorithm and also some front-to-front searches) All of which have been based on the 8/15-puzzle and can solve reasonably hard problems within a few seconds in Java. I'm comfortable using C languages or scripting ones, as all I'll be needing will be hashtables and priority queues for the ADTs.</p>

<p>So is there any opensource software which I can achieve simulations with (in real time) with reasonable ease. If not, does creating my own simulator sound out of the question? If I were to do that, then it would most likely just be a 2D simulator which <em>knows</em> of its surrounds within a given radius... It would just be nice to do it on something already out there as the experiments wouldn't be (as) biased...</p>

<p><a href=""http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>Player is an open source robotics platform, and stage is a simulation environment that's coupled with it. In it's basic form you can quickly create a mobile 2D robot, with a laser/IR/sonar scanner and simulate it in the simulation environment. Here's a picture of what it would look like: <a href=""http://goo.gl/BV4X8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/BV4X8</a></p>

<p>It's open source, fairly straightforward to install (on linux anyway) and write simple configurations for. There's tutorials to help you along too.</p>
