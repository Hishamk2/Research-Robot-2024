297,1590073,Line Tracking Robot,|arduino|robotics|,"<p>Me and my friends are building a line tracking robot based on my previous question about how to track white line on a black surface. We settled on using photo resistors and a arduino board. Now all the reflectance sensors I've found are should be placed very close to the line 1 - 2 cm above the line. Now one of my team mates had a heated argument with the professor that there are reflectance sensors that can track 10cm or more but we could not find any.</p>

<pre><code>Hi Nima,

There are two types of sensors, digital and analog.  The Analog sensors you
can basically read like you would the LEGO light sensor.  If you have that
working then you can read the HiTechnic analog sensors.  These include the
EOPD, Gyro as well as the Touch Multiplexer.

For the TMUX there is [sample NXC code][1] on the product info page.
You should be able to use that as a basis if you want to support this device.

The other sensors are digital I2C sensors.  Most of these sensors have I2C
register information on their respective product information page and/or it
was included on a sheet that came with the sensor.  First of all, to make
these sensors work with your framework you need to have I2C communications
working.  After that it will be a matter of creating your own API that uses
the I2C interface with the sensors.  I recommend that you download and look
at Xander Soldaat's RobotC driver suite for the HiTechnic sensors.  You will
find this near the bottom of the HiTechnic downloads page.

Regards,
Gus

Also, I'm guessing that the robot id is the same as the short address -- if not you will need to create some code to map back and forth between the robot ID and the short address.  I'm also guessing that you are either using something like the <code>select</code> system call to wait for data from any of your robots or trying to read from each one.</p>

<p>If this is the case then you should be able to create a state machine for each robot and whenever you get data from that robot you feed that robot's state machine which processes it and generate a reply to that robot (or even sends data to the other robots' state machines).  The state machine will be almost like your single robot program, except that it will rely on an event loop getting data from the robots for it.  You may also want the event loop to be able to supply timer alarms for the state machines.  This is similar to the way you would write a http server that could handle multiple clients at one time.</p>

<p>If I was totally wrong about your API and you have those zigbee radios that just act as a serial port without wires then you are in a mess, because I think that you will have to reconfigure them in order to use more than one endpoint at a time -- and will have to change the API you use to communicate with the robots.</p>

<p>I think the way to solve it is to consider a related problem: two wheels located correctly, but both skewed a little to the left (which is exactly the situation you're in, thinking of the diagonal between the wheels as the ""wheelbase"").

My challenge is to avoid that the robot gets trapped in ""local minimum"" when using the ""potential field"" method. Instead of using a ""random walk"" approach to avoid that the robot gets trapped I have thought about whether it is possible to implement a variation of A* which could act as a sort of guide for precisely to avoid that the robot gets trapped in ""local minimum"".</p>

954,4973854,C or C++ for a Robot?,|c++|c|robotics|,"<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>I am trying to decide between C and C++ for my robot. I am a 5+ year veteran of Visual Basic.NET, however I'm going with Linux (Ubuntu) on this robot, and there is a compatibility problem between Linux and the .NET Framework. I want to stick with whichever language I choose for all of my projects, so I want to make sure that I choose the most appropriate one for the task.
For reference, I will describe my current robot in progress and what I am going to do with it. I am in the process of building a full-sized R4 Astromech (yep, I'm one of those guys). I have incorporated a PC motherboard with an Intel Core 2 2.1 GHz processor, 1 GB RAM. I will be using a scratch-built parallel interface card to control the drive motors, head motor, as well as a secondary parallel interface card (going to a second parallel port) which all of the sensors (IR, Ultrasonic Ranging, Visual Recognition via webcam, etc.) will be going to. Commands will be given using speech recognition (currently have a VB.NET scratch-built recognition program that I will be adapting to the new language).
Given the specifications and desired goals listed above, would I be better off with C or C++? I greatly appreciate any suggestions that you might have.
Thanks!

<p>I doubt I can use object recognition based on ""database of obstacles"" search, since I don't know what might the obstruction look like.
I assume color recognition might be problematic if the path does not differ a lot from the object itself.</p>

<p>Possibly, adding one more camera and computing a 3D image (like a Kinect does) would work, but that would not run as smooth as I require.</p>

Acquire a bunch of images of path at different distances, illumination, etc. and manually label the ground in each image. Use this labeled data to train a classifier that classifies each pixel as either ""road"" or ""not road."" Depending upon the texture of the road, this could be as simple as classifying each pixels' RGB (or HSV) values or using OpenCv's built-in histogram back-projection (i.e. <code>cv::CalcBackProjectPatch()</code>).</p>

<p>I suggest beginning with manual thresholds, moving to histogram-based matching, and only using a full-fledged machine learning classifier (such as a Naive Bayes Classifier or a SVM) if the simpler techniques fail. Once the entire image is classified, all pixels that are identified as ""not road"" are obstacles. By classifying the <em>road instead of the obstacles</em>, we completely avoided building a ""database of objects"".</p>

<p>Well, you are trying to find your position given a measurement and a map. That should be possible, and it wouldn't matter from which direction the map was created. However, there is the loop closure problem. Because you are creating a 3D map at the same time as you are trying to find your way around, you don't know whether you are at a new place or at a place you have seen before. </p>

This is a difficult task!</p>

<p>Actually, it's more than one. First you have simple obstacle avoidance (i.e. <code>Don't drive into things.</code>). Then you want to do simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM, read Wikipedia on that) and finally you want to do path planning (i.e. sweeping the floor without covering area twice).</p>

However, since we're new to this field with practically no background in embedded systems or operating systems, and there are a wide range of options available, we're not sure which one would be a suitable choice.

<p>Neither of the options you have suggested would likely make into my list.</p>

<p>Anything Linux based will require an MMU (unless using uCLinux or its derivitives, but MMU support is one of the few good reasons for using Linux in an embedded system).  Linux is not intended to be a real-time OS and any real-time support it has is pretty much an after-thought, and will seldom be as deterministic as a true RTOS.  Any Linux will also require significant memory resources just to boot-up, expect a minimum of 4Mb of RAM for anything usable, while RTOS kernels such as FreeRTOS and uC/OS-II require only about 4Kb - you are comparing chalk with cheese here.  That said they do not have the utility of a Linux based OS such as file-systems, or networking support (although those can be added as stand-alone libraries).</p>

<p>If you are going to be performing the motion-control and sensor/actuator functions on the same processor as your cognitive functions, then you certainly need a deterministic RTOS.  If however the platform will be a distributed system with separate processors dealing with motion-control and other real-time sensor/actuator I/O, then you may get away with a simple RTOS kernel or no OS at all in the I/O processors (which can also then be smaller, less powerful processors) and a GPOS in the cognitive (decision making and planning) processor.</p>

<p>I have evaluated FreeRTOS recently, it is minimalistic, simple and small, providing only the basic threading, timing and IPC mechanisms and little else.  It works, but so do many other more attractive options, both commercial and non-commercial.  I compared it with <a href=""http://www.keil.com/rl-arm/kernel.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">Keil's RTX kernel</a> (included with their MDK-ARM tool suite), and the commercial <a href=""http://www.segger.com/embos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Segger embOS</a>.  It has significantly slower context switching time that the other two candidates (though still in the microseconds on a 72MHz Cortex-M3, and faster than anything you are likely to achieve with Linux).</p>

<p>uC/OS-II is well designed and documented (in Jean Labrosse's book), and is great if you aim were to see how an RTOS works.  Its biggest failing is its very restrictive priority scheduling scheme, which is efficient for very small targets, but possibly not as flexible as you might like.  Each thread must be assigned a distinct priority level so it has no support for round-robin scheduling, useful for non-real-time background tasks. uC/OS-III fixes that shortcoming, but again so do many other options.</p>

<p>If your target processor has an MMU I strongly suggest the use of an OS that supports it in such a way that each thread or process is protected from any other, the system will be far more robust and easy to debug, especially when developed as a team.  In such an OS an errant task that would otherwise stomp on some other thread's resources with non-deterministic and generally hard to debug results, will instead cause an exception and halt right where the error occurred, rather than perhaps sometime later when the corrupted data gets used.</p>

<p>You probably need not restrict yourself to a free or open-source RTOS, many vendors allow free use for education and evaluation.  I would strongly suggest that you consider <a href=""http://www.qnx.com/products/neutrino-rtos/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">QNX Neutrino</a>, it is <a href=""http://www.qnx.com/products/evaluation/academic_faculty.html"" rel=""nofollow"">free for non-commercial and academic use</a>, and has the most robust intrinsic MMU support available in any RTOS, and all the development tools you need including the Eclipse based Momentics IDE are included.  It is more than just a mere scheduling kernel, including support for all the services you would expect of a complete OS. It runs on ARM, x86, SH-4 PowerPC and MIPS architectures.  Running on x86 is particularly useful since it means you can test and evaluate it, and even develop much of your code in a <a href=""http://www.qnx.com/products/evaluation/#target"" rel=""nofollow"">VM running on your desktop</a>.</p>

<p>Another alternative that is true hard-real-time, while supporting OS services beyond mere scheduling and IPC, is <a href=""http://ecos.sourceware.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">eCos</a>.  It has a native, POSIX and uITRON API, standard drivers for CAN, ADC, SPI, I2C, FLASH, PCI, Serial, Filesystems, USB and PCI and more, and includes TCP/IP networking support.  It is a complete OS in that sense, but unlike Linux is not monolithic; it is scalable and statically linked to your application code, so that features you do not use are simply not included in the runtime binary.  It runs on ARM, CalmRISC, Cortex-M, FR-V, FR30, H8, IA32, 68K/ColdFire, Matsushita AM3x, MIPS, NEC V8xx, PowerPC, SPARC, and SuperH.  Again in theory you could run the IA32 (x86) port it on a VM on a PC for test and development of high level code, though you'd have to get that working yourself unlike QNX's out of the box evaluation.</p>

<p>Chapter 2 of Labrosse's uC/OS-II book gives a general overview of RTOS concepts such as scheduling, synchronisation and IPC that are applicable to most RTOS not just uC/OS-II.

<p><strong>Added regarding CONFIG_PREMPT_RT:</strong></p>

<p>It does not render Linux a hard real-time OS.  It may be suitable for some applications.  If you are doing PID motion control (rather than using a dedicated controller or separate processor), or any kind of closed loop feedback control for that matter, this patch will not enable it in my opinion, at least not reliably.

<p>For example suppose you have a single camera. In this case you would have to calibrate it (i.e. compute the values for) for its intrinsics parameters (focal length, principal point, skew coefficient). You would do that using a calibration board (e.g., <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessboard_detection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Checkerboard</a>, <a href=""https://april.eecs.umich.edu/wiki/AprilTags"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AprilTag</a>).</p>

<p>Now, you may say that these parameters are known and reported by the manufacturers of that camera and we can look them up either at the manual or at its corresponding documentation. However that's not always the case:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Manufacturers might provide you with that calibration information. Even if they do though, those numbers would probably be rough so that they address the whole family of products. That is, they'll probably not going to calibrate every single camera. You could use these calibration parameters but if you want higher accuracy you are better off using them as a rough estimate and do the calibration yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>The device may be affected by the environment and the overall conditions it is operating in (temperature, humidity etc.). For example, say you have a stereo camera. In that case you would calibrate for the length between the two independent RGB cameras. But that length may change depending on the temperature (heating will make the rigid link between the cameras expand).</p></li>
<li><p>The specifications of the device may change depending on the its age and usage so it makes sense to recompute its calibration parameters every N number of years.</p></li>

So, both come with their own programming requirements, namely that the eye tracker software is based in python and is the main language in which I'm programming. Our haptic robot has an API in C, so I've had to write a wrapper in C, compile it as a DLL, and use ctypes in python to load the functions.</p>

<p>The theory of the python custom class is to instantiate an object (self.pyMyHapObj = pyMyHap()) of the loaded DLL class. Making a call to the function 'initOmni' successfully initializes the robot, however a call to 'getCoord' does not return the expected value. In fact, the result I get from 'getCoord' is 1 (and it is listed as 1, not 1.0, so I think it is returning an integer, not a double as it should).</p>

<p>In MATLAB, I have use the DLL library, and both the myHapInit and myHapCoord functions work, and I can initialize the robot and query the position coordinates successfully.</p>

<p>So what is it about my python class that is causing ctypes to not have the proper value returned from myHapCoord from my DLL?</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks</p>

<p>edit: Python version 2.3, if it matters... I'm stuck to that version.</p>

<p>We believe that the bt878 driver is loaded correctly, and that the frame grabber is working properly. When the camera is powered off the frame-grabber (viewed in either camorama, vlc or gstreamer-properties programs) is blue, and when the camera is powered on, the image received from the camera is very noisy. No features can be detected but changes in light can be seen.</p>

<p>We have had the camera working before properly (implying that the drivers are ok), however it appears that it is almost random, and dependent on what viewing programs we use and in what order. Once the camera is working, it remains working until we power off the robot. We think this means that the camera is not initialised properly, and so is sending noisy data. Does anyone know of a good way to initialise a camera linked to a BTTV PCI device, besides just ensuring the camera is powered on?</p>

<p>Specifically the camera is part of a manipulator which is installed on a SeekurJr robot from Mobile Robotics. It is required that the manipulator is initialised (turning the camera on) before viewing the stream, which we do. </p>

<p>The camera is a RVision SEE camera.</p>

<li><p>try connecting another camera to your framegrabber card, and see what the image looks like.</p></li>

<p>from the bttv-side, the only configuration that could help, is to select the correct video norm, e.g. whether camera and grabber both agree that they are using <em>PAL</em> or <em>NTSC</em> or whatever (and of course the various subformats).</p>

<li>try changing the norm with any viewer program, that allows that during playback, e.g. <code>xawtv</code></li>

Since I really care about getting the packets over to the UAV from the base station as quickly as possible I assume using UDP is the way to go. </p>

<p>Am I way off? Have I oversimplified this problem? </p>

<p>I would higly recommend that you have an internal control loop stabilising the UAV and only using the data connection for sending more behaviour oriented commands such as Fly west, Fly east etc. </p>

<p>I assume you are useing some kind of wireless transmitter for the connection. </p>

<p>If you use UDP you cannot be sure that the control packets reaches the UAV, which could cause it to become unstable and crash.</p>

<p>If you use TCP you cannot guarantee that the control packets reaches the UAV with regular time intervals, which might cause it become unstable and cause a crash.</p>

<p>If you really want to control everything from a base station i would recommend TCP as you can ensure that your control packets reaches the UAV. If you are using a standard wireless transmission you should have plenty of bandwith to retransmit packets that are lost.</p>

<p>If you wish to send large amounts of data eg. Video or sound without any direct impact on UAV stability i would definately go for UDP as you wouldn't care if you lost a frame or two.</p>

<p>I hope it makes sense.</p>

An 8-bit controller performs low level tasks and the PC is doing the image processing. I plan to implement it in a single room where the robot is placed and the robot and environment are tracked by a camera from a height or from the ceiling of the room. First, the robot needs to be mapped, like this <a href=""http://www.societyofrobots.com/programming_wavefront.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.societyofrobots.com/programming_wavefront.shtml</a></p>

<p>To do:</p>

<p>Track the robot from some height using camera Following the wavefont algorithim to locate robot and obstacles.</p>

<p>Procedure:(just my idea)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The camera will give image of the robot surrounded by obstacles in
the random places. using some opencv technique draw some grind over
the image.</p></li>
<li><p>Locating the grid which contain robot(by having some colored symbol
over the robot) and locating the grids containing the obstacle.</p></li>
<li><p>Now the grids with obstacle is thought as wall and the remaining is
the free space for the robot to navigate.</p></li>
<li><p>robot is going to get the goal place which should be reached is given
from the pc(may be like point the place to reach in the image by
mouse click).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>firstly finding the obstacle from the video stream is to be done for that iam going to catch a image of the robot which is in the room now the image is  edit by manually in M.S paint by filling the grid with stationary obstacle by some color say red.</p>

<p>now the edited image is going to be the reference and it is compared with video stream to tell the free space available to robot.</p>

<p>each grid is given some value using that place value of the robot should be determined </p>

<p>now i should be able to give some grid value in the free space to make it as goal for the robot </p>

<p>now the Pc should calculate and tell the robot which grid should be traveled to reach the goal. the only thing the robot need to figure out itself is dynamic obstacle avoidance like cat walking across the robot </p>

<p>comparing the area of the room with the image of some dimension to find how far the robot moved and how far to go</p>

<p>is it possible to do? can anybody help me to do this? </p>

With C++11, you have <code>std::atomic</code> (see <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> or <a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/atomic/atomic/atomic/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. For an earlier version of C++, I think you need to use some library or compiler specific data type, which offers atomic data types.</p>

<p>If you make some assumptions about how multithreading works for your CPU and operating system, you <em>may</em> get away with just declaring shared variables <code>volatile</code> and reading value to temp variable when you use it. <code>volatile</code> is really meant for cases like reading hardware-mapped values, where value must be read from the memory every time, so many optimizations are not possible. It does not guarantee atomic updates in itself, because a thread modifying a value may be interrupted in the middle of update, and then another read may read invalid, partially updated value. For booleans this should be fairly safe. For integers which do not cross memory word boundary and which word size or less, this may be safe on many CPUs, which will not interrupt a thread in the middle of writing single memory word. Otherwise, it is data corruption waiting to happen. Some (today uncommon) CPUs also do not synchronize caches between multiple CPU cores, and in that case <code>volatile</code> will not help, different threads may see different cached value. So conclusion: use <code>volatile</code> as last resort hack!</p>

<p>I have created a PiBotController which i plan to run on my laptop which i want to pass the controls (inputs from arrow keys) to the raspberry pi controlling my robot. Now the hardware side of this isn't the issue i have created a program that responds to arrow key inputs and i can control the motors on the pi through a ssh connection.</p>

<p>Searching online i found the following basic server and client code using socketserver which i can get to work sending a simple string.</p>

<p>Server:</p>

<pre><code>import socketserver

class MyTCPHandler(socketserver.BaseRequestHandler):
""""""
The RequestHandler class for our server.

It is instantiated once per connection to the server, and must
override the handle() method to implement communication to the
client.
""""""

    def handle(self):
        # self.request is the TCP socket connected to the client
        self.data = self.request.recv(1024).strip()
        print(""{} wrote:"".format(self.client_address[0]))
        print(self.data)
        # just send back the same data, but upper-cased
        self.request.sendall(self.data.upper())

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    HOST, PORT = ""localhost"", 9999

# Create the server, binding to localhost on port 9999
server = socketserver.TCPServer((HOST, PORT), MyTCPHandler)

# Activate the server; this will keep running until you
# interrupt the program with Ctrl-C
server.serve_forever()
</code></pre>

<p>Client:</p>

<pre><code>import socket
import sys

HOST, PORT = ""192.168.2.12"", 9999
data = ""this here data wont send!! ""


# Create a socket (SOCK_STREAM means a TCP socket)
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

try:
    # Connect to server and send data
    sock.connect((HOST, PORT))
    sock.sendall(bytes(data + ""\n"", ""utf-8""))

    # Receive data from the server and shut down
    received = str(sock.recv(1024), ""utf-8"")
finally:
    sock.close()

print(""Sent:     {}"".format(data))
print(""Received: {}"".format(received))
</code></pre>

<p>Now this works fine and prints the results both on my Raspberry Pi (server) and on my laptop (client) however i have tried multiple times to combine it into a function that activates along with my key press' and releases' like i have in my controller.</p>

<p>this program compiles fine but then doesn't send any data to the server? (i'm aware its still just sending a string but i thought id start with something easy... and well evidently i got stuck so it is probably for the best)</p>

<p>Any suggestions to make it work just sending the string or sending the varibales drive and steering every time they change would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Dave xx</p>

<p><em><strong>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>here is the transmit function i got to it work in the sense it sends data whenever i do a key press/release (like i wanted before) however it only sends the initial setting for the variables of 'idle'. Looking at the code now as well i think i should probably take the host and port info and creating a socket connection out of the function that runs every time? but im not sure so here is what i have right now anyway.</p>

<pre><code>def transmit():
    HOST, PORT = ""192.168.2.12"", 9999
    DriveSend = drivelabel.get
    SteeringSend = steeringlabel.get


    # Create a socket (SOCK_STREAM means a TCP socket)

        sock.sendall(bytes(Steering + ""\n"", ""utf-8""))

",8/9/2013 15:16,18150274,4084,1,0,1,0,2668299,"Bristol, United Kingdom",8/9/2013 14:40,47,18150274,"<p>The problem is that when Tkinter catches a key event, it triggers the more specific binding first (for example 'Key-Up'), and the event is never passed to the more general binding ('Key').  Therefore, when you press the 'up' key, KeyUp is called, but transmit is never called.</p>

<p>One way to solve this would be to just call transmit() within all the callback functions (KeyUp, KeyDown, etc).</p>

<p>For example, KeyUp would become</p>

<pre><code>def KeyUp(event):
    Drive = 'forward'
    drivelabel.set(Drive)
    labeldown.grid_remove()
    labelup.grid(row=2, column=2)
    transmit()
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can get rid of the event binding to 'Key'.</p>

<p>Another option would be to make ""Drive"" and ""Steering"" into Tkinter.StringVar objects, then bind to write events using ""trace"", like this:</p>

<pre><code>Drive = tk.StringVar()
Drive.set('idle')
Drive.trace('w', transmit)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>trace</code> sends a bunch of arguments to the callback, so you'd have to edit <code>transmit</code> to accept them.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Ok, I see the problems - there are three.  </p>

<p>1.  When you write </p>

<pre><code>Drive = 'forward'
</code></pre>

<p>in your callback functions, you're <strong>not</strong> setting the variable <code>Drive</code> in your module namespace, you're setting <code>Drive</code> in the local function namespace, so the module-namespace <code>Drive</code> never changes, so when <code>transmit</code> accesses it, it's always the same.</p>

<p>2.  In <code>transmit</code>, you write </p>

<pre><code>DriveSend = drivelabel.get
SteeringSend = steeringlabel.get
</code></pre>

<p>This is a good idea, but you're just referencing the functions, not calling them.  You need</p>

<pre><code>DriveSend = drivelabel.get()
SteeringSend = steeringlabel.get()
</code></pre>

<p>3.  In <code>transmit</code>, the values you send through the socket are the module-level variables <code>Drive</code> and <code>Steering</code> (which never change as per problem #1), rather than <code>DriveSend</code> and <code>SteeringSend</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p>I would recommend doing away with all the <code>Drive</code> and <code>Steering</code> variables entirely, and just using the <code>StringVars</code> 'drivelabel<code>and</code>steeringlabel`.  Thus your callbacks can become:</p>

<pre><code>def KeyUp(event):
#    Drive = 'forward'   (this doesn't actually do any harm, but to avoid confusion I'd just get rid of the Drive variables altogether)
    drivelabel.set('forward')
    labeldown.grid_remove()
    labelup.grid(row=2, column=2)
</code></pre>

<p>(and so on for the rest of the callbacks) and your transmit function will become</p>

<pre><code>def transmit():
    HOST, PORT = ""192.168.2.12"", 9999
    DriveSend = drivelabel.get()        # Note the ()
    SteeringSend = steeringlabel.get()

    # Create a socket (SOCK_STREAM means a TCP socket)
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    try:
        # Connect to server and send data
        sock.connect((HOST, PORT))
        sock.sendall(bytes(DriveSend + ""\n"", ""utf-8""))    # Note Drive ==&gt; DriveSend
        sock.sendall(bytes(SteeringSend + ""\n"", ""utf-8"")) # Note Steering ==&gt; SteeringSend

        # Receive data from the server and shut down
        received = str(sock.recv(1024), ""utf-8"")
    finally:
        sock.close()

    print(""Sent:     {}"".format(SteeringSend))   # Note Steering ==&gt; SteeringSend
    print(""Sent:     {}"".format(DriveSend))      # Note Drive ==&gt; DriveSend
    print(""Received: {}"".format(received))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>modified solution (from OP):</strong></p>

<p>Since playing around with this method for a little while i found that constantly changing the variables every 100ms due to key being held down is troublesome and causes isues with the smoothness of the motor control when i am for example just driving forward. to fix this i used the following edit into each function</p>

<pre><code>def KeyUp(event):
    if drivelabel.get() == ""forward"":
        pass
    else:
        drivelabel.set(""forward"")
        labeldown.grid_remove()
        labelup.grid(row=2, column=2)
        transmit()
        print (drivelabel.get())
</code></pre>

<p>The code now checks if the varibale is already set to the relevent direction if it is it does nothing, otherwise it modifies it. the print line is just there for me to check it was working properly and could be removed or commented out.</p>

I'm currently trying to build some wheel encoders using reflectance sensors. I realised a while back that I would probably need to use threading to achieve this, seeing as the robot needs to monitor both the left and right encoders at the same time. The code below is what I have so far: </p>

        current_dist = angle #Distance away from target
        R.motors[self.motor].target = start_speed
        while current_dist &gt; 360:
            newcount = self.count - startcount
            current_dist = angle - newcount*seg
            R.motors[self.motor].target = 50
        while abs(current_dist) &gt; seg/2:  
            newcount = self.count - startcount

</code></pre>

<p>The sr module is provided by Southampton University, who are running the competition. It allows us to interact with the robot's hardware. </p>

<p>Now, the threads which get created seem to allow the two reflectance sensors to be monitored separately. This bit of code: <code>R.io[0].input[self.pin].query.d</code> works out whether the value coming from the reflectance sensor has changed. The 'rotations' method turns the wheel through a certain angle by constantly checking how many degrees the wheel has already turned through, and slowing it down as it reaches the end. I would like both wheels to start turning when I run the program, and then slow down and stop when they have gone through 2 rotations. Currently though, when I run the program, one wheel starts turning and slows down and stops, followed by the other wheel. It seems to me like the 'rotations' method is not running in a thread, like the 'run' method is. Is it only the code under the 'run' method that runs in a thread, or is it the whole class?</p>

<p>If it helps, I've been following this tutorial: <a href=""http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Python/Basic-Threading-in-Python/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Python/Basic-Threading-in-Python/1/</a></p>

<p>Also, I would like to know why it is possible to start a thread only with <code>Encoder(0,0).start()</code>. Why do you not have to create an object using the class (e.g. <code>Thread = Encoder(0,0).start()</code> for a new thread to be created?</p>

<p>Sorry if the terminoligy I've used isn't up to scratch, as you can probably tell I'm quite new to threading, and programming in general. </p>

 * Get the min and max out of this array

Before jumping into the question, let me first give a brief description of the set up of this project.</p>

<p>The set up consists of a facility where there is a rail system and there are multiple robots mounted on them. The environment is static with only mobile robots. As for now it can be 3 robots wagon on these rails. These robots are for pick-and-place tasks.There is, as such no communication between these robots but they are connected to the server, which gives the robots tasks.</p>

<p>Please have a look at the rough sketch (pardon me for this bad diagram) to have an idea of the set-up. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ddM3X.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>From the above diagram, R1 and R2 are robots on the rails. The server may assign a job to robot R1 for picking an object at ""A"" and dropping it at ""B"" and the robot has to move completely autonomous. 
Now, my queries are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>How the robot R1 moves to ""A"" and then to ""B"", taking the optimal path, concerning Path Planning of the robot?</li>
<li>How the robot avoid collision in a static map, with other mobile robots on the rails, concerning collision avoidance ? (I am thinking of using a camera to detect the other robot)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have looked into some literature and have a basic idea. I have also gone through some of the asked <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19406147/path-planning-and-obstacle-avoidance-algorithms"">question</a> in here. But I dont have any concrete idea to start working. I am looking for some advice/ideas/algorithms/literature to go about the problem.

<p>To avoid collision, one method would be to allow motion in only one direction along the rails (a figure of 8 in this case).  Overall it should not be a problem since you are controlling the bots from a central server.</p>

<p>Maybe a slight step forward.  See that webipi uses its own 'loop' and I added the loop code to check what the status of the motor GPIO's are and the distance and if the motor is running and if the distance is too short then stop. Car moves now when I press the forward button and stops when I release it and when moving forward and distance is less then 30cm it will stop.  Only problem is that when the distance is too short and I press the forward button too quickly multiple times, I now get a ""GPIO.output(Echo,1)

The Robot C tutorial does not cover this or even introduce the language and library features needed to do it.</p>

<p>In this case, you want the light sensor to trigger an LED on/off sequence that lasts for 1 second, while the bump sensors trigger motor actions that last until those sensors are no longer bumping.</p>

<p>The problem here is your motor control's inner <code>while</code> loops are blocking up the thread, mostly keeping it from getting around to running the LED control loop. The LED control loop likewise blocks up the thread for 7 seconds, delaying it from running the motor control loop.</p>

<p>In general, each iteration of a robot control loop should read sensors, send output commands, remember any state that it needs to process later, then loop again so all parts of the control loop get to run each cycle (as often as possible or at a controlled rate). Don't block the control flow by staying in an inner <code>while</code> loop until a sensor changes.</p>

<p>The first step is to unblock the motor control loop:</p>

<pre><code>while (true) {

  // Light sensor LED control code ...

  // Bumper/motor control
  if (SensorValue(bumpSwitch) == 1) {
    startMotor(rightMotor, -55);
    startMotor(leftMotor, -55);
  } else if (SensorValue(bumpSwitch2) == 1){
    startMotor(rightMotor, 55);
    startMotor(leftMotor, 55);
  } else {
    stopMotor(rightMotor);
    stopMotor(leftMotor);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now your current LED control code still calls <code>wait(1)</code> 7 times. According to <a href=""http://www.robotc.net/support/nxt/ROBOTC-for-Beginners/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robotc.net/support/nxt/ROBOTC-for-Beginners/</a> <code>wait(1)</code> waits for 1.0 seconds, so this part of the code currently takes 7 seconds to run. That's a long time between checking the bump switches.</p>

<p>Furthermore, your code has no significant delay between turning the LEDs off and back on again, so you won't actually notice the LEDs turn off until the end of that sequence.</p>

<p>So the second step is to fix the LED control code from blocking the control loop. Basically there are two approaches (I don't know if Robot C supports the first choice, but it's simpler):</p>

<ol>
<li>When the light sensor is above-threshold <em>and</em> it was below-threshold in the previous iteration, i.e. it just transitioned, then start [or ""fork""] a thread (or task) to run a LED on/off loop. That thread should loop 7 times: {turn the LEDs on, <code>wait(1.0/14.0)</code> seconds, turn the LEDs off, then <code>wait(1.0/14.0)</code> seconds}. That way, 7 cycles around the loop will take 7 * (1/14 + 1/14) = 1.0 seconds. I wrote that as <code>1.0/14.0</code> rather than <code>1/14</code> because many programming languages compute <code>1/14</code> in integer math, yielding <code>0</code>, while <code>1.0/14.0</code> uses floating point math. I don't know about Robot C. Or, you could use <code>wait1Msec(71)</code> to wait 71 msec, which is about 1/14 second.</li>
<li>Use variables to track the sequencing through the flash-LED loop. Each cycle around the main loop, use <code>if</code> statements to check those variables, do the next step in the flash-LED cycle if it's time, and update those variables. The steps are: turn on the LEDs when it was in the initial state and the light sensor is above-threshold, turn off the LEDs when it's 1/14 of a second later, turn on the LEDs when it's 1/14 of a second later, ... turn off and set the tracking variables back to the initial state after 14 of those steps. The simplest tracking variable would be a counter from 0 (initial state) to 14 (doing the last LED ""OFF"" phase) and the value of the system clock from the last change, to let you detect when the clock is 71 msec later than that. Once it finishes step 14, go back to 0. There are alternatives for the tracking variables, such as 3 separate variables for whether it's currently flashing, which of the 7 flash cycles it's currently doing, whether it's in the ON or OFF phase of that cycle, and the clock reading.</li>
</ol>

<p>Approach #2 is trickier because doing two things at once is tricky. (People who think they can multitask by texting while driving are dangerously wrong.)</p>

<p>A much simpler approach works if the robot doesn't need to run the bumper/motor control loop while flashing the LEDs, that is, if it doesn't mind being unresponsive to the bumpers while flashing the LEDs for 1 second. If those bumper sensors are keeping the robot from running off the end of the table, being unresponsive for 1 second is bad news. But if it's OK for the robot to press against the bumper for 1 second while flashing the lights, then the light sensor LED part of the code could go something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (true) {
  // Light sensor LED control code
  if (SensorValue(lightSensor) &gt; 400) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 7; ++i) {
      turnLEDOn(ledGreen);
      turnLEDOn(ledRed);
      wait1Msec(71); // 1/14 second
      turnLEDOff(ledGreen);
      turnLEDOff(ledRed);
      wait1Msec(71);
    }
  }

  // Bumper/motor control code ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes another simplifying assumption: That if the light sensor is still bright after finishing the 1 second LED flashing loop, it's OK to do another 1 second flashing loop next time around the main control loop, which occurs very soon. So as long as the light sensor is bright, the LEDs will keep flashing and the motors will only check the bumpers once per second.

2178,28865322,Raspberry Pi quadcopter thrashes at high speeds,|java|raspberry-pi|robotics|control-theory|pid-controller|,"<p>I am attempting to build a raspberry pi based quadcopter. So far I have succeeded in interfacing with all the hardware, and I have written a PID controller that is fairly stable at low throttle. The problem is that at higher throttle the quadcopter starts thrashing and jerking. I have not even been able to get it off the ground yet, all my testing has been done on a test bench. Is this a problem with my code, or perhaps a bad motor? any suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>

2208,29226752,Differential drive robots: converting wheel speeds to lin/ang velocities,|box2d|robotics|kinematics|,"<p>I am modeling a simple differential drive robot (such as the e-Puck, Khepera, etc.) with pyBox2D. This class of robots is usually controlled by indicating speeds for the right and left wheel in rad/sec.<br>
However, Box2D can only control a (kinematic) body through two parameters: linear velocity (in meters/sec, as a 2D vector) and angular velocity (in rad/sec). I need to convert my wheel speeds to linear + angular velocities.</p>

<p>Linear velocity is actually straightforward. Given a wheel radius r in meters, and current robot orientation theta in radians, the forward speed is simply the average of the two wheel speeds in meters/sec and reduced to a vector according to current orientation:</p>

<p>(1) forwardSpeed = ((rightSpeed * r) + (leftSpeed * r)) / 2</p>

<p>(2) linearVelocity = (forwardSpeed * cos(theta), forwardSpeed * sin(theta))  </p>

<p>I cannot quite figure out the correct formula for angular velocity, though. Intuitively, it should be the difference between the two speeds modulo the distance between the wheels:</p>

<p>(3) angularVelocity = (rightSpeed - leftSpeed) / wheelSeparation  </p>

<p>in the limit cases: when right = left, the robot spins in place, and when either rightSpeed = 0 or leftSpeed = 0, the robot spins (pivots) around the stationary wheel, i.e. in a circle with radius = to the separation between the wheels.</p>

<p>I do not get the expected behavior with formula (3), though. As a test, I set the left wheel speed to 0 and progressively increased the value of the right wheel 's speed. The expected behavior is that the robot's should spin around the left wheel with increased velocity.
Instead, the robot spins in circles of increasing radius, i.e it spirals outward, which suggests that the angular velocity is insufficient. </p>

<p>Notice that I am using a Box2D kinematic body for the robot, so friction does not play a role in my results. </p>

Presumably the origin of the robot is in the center of the body, in which case you can never get it to rotate around one wheel (that would need both a rotate and translate). It might actually be easier to model the robot as a dynamic body and apply forces where the wheels are. If you don't want to deal with friction losses etc, you could use a kinematic body for each wheel and connect them to the main (dynamic) body with revolute joints.</p>

<p>I think the problem is when the trig functions get introduced. The parameters for them are supposed to be in radians, they return the answer is degrees. Somewhere I am mixing up the two. I just don't know where. Thanks</p>
",10/6/2015 19:56,,1885,1,0,1,,,,,,32995487,"<p>There is, I'm afraid, quite a bit wrong with this, either in your code or in the equations you're using. Your equation for theta2 doesn't make any sense to me if x and y are distances and a1 and a2 are angles (check your equation or give a source). Even if these should be d1 and d2, this equation involves subtracting two quantities with different dimensions (length^4 and length^2).</p>

<p>Then check your implementation of it, which does not evaluate the equation as given.</p>

<p>My advice about radians / degrees is to use radians throughout: accept the angles in degrees if you want, but then immediately convert to radians for the calculations, and convert angular results back to degrees for output.</p>

<p>Some more advice:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you don't need to cast your floats to strings for output using print, just use <code>print('x: ', x)</code> and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Give your variables the same names as the symbols they represent in your formula. This would make it easier to debug (well, it would if the  equations were correct).</p></li>

Unfortunately I'm fairly new to the area of robotics and I need some tips how to solve some problems. Currently I'm working on the localization/orientation of the robot and I'm wondering which approach of localization would fit best in my project.</p>

<p><strong>A short explanation of the project:</strong>
The robot has a fixed starting position and has to walk around on a boardwhich has a size of about 3x3 meter ( I will post a picture of the board when i reach 10 reputation). There are no obstacles on the field except the game tokens and the game lines are marked yellow on the board. For orientation I use the two camera devices the robot has.</p>

<p>I found some approaches like </p>

<p><strong>Monte Carlo Localization</strong></p>

<p><strong>SLAM</strong> (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)</p>

<p>but these approaches seem to be quite complex for a beginner like me and I would really appreciate if some has some good ideas what would be a simpler way to solve this problem. Functionality has for me a far higher priority than performance.</p>

<p>First thing first, you need to have a map of your board. This should be easy in your case, cause your environment is static. There are few <a href=""http://forums.trossenrobotics.com/tutorials/introduction-129/an-introduction-to-mapping-and-localization-3274/"" rel=""nofollow"">technique</a> to do this mapping from your board. For your case I would suggest to have a metric map, which is an occupancy grid. Assign coordinates to each cell in the grid. This will be helpful in robot navigation.</p>

<p>As you have mentioned, your robot starts from a fixed position. On start up, initialize your robot with this reference location and orientation (with respect to X-Y axes of the grid, may be you don't need the cameras, I am not sure!!). By initialization I mean, mark your position on the grid.</p>

<p>Use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning"" rel=""nofollow"">Dead Reckoning</a> for localization and keep updating position and orientation of your robot as it move through the board. I would hope that your robot get some feedback from the servos, like number of rotations and so forth. Do that math and update the position coordinates of your robot as it move into different cell in the grid.</p>

<p>You can use <a href=""http://wiki.gamegardens.com/Path_Finding_Tutorial"" rel=""nofollow"">A-Star</a> algorithm to find a path for your robot. You need to do the path planning before you want to navigate. You also have to mark those game tokens on the grid, to avoid collisions in planning the path. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What data structure could be used to store the structure (geometry, topology) of the map into the robot's memory?</p>

<p>Well there should be many possible ways to do that. Basically, this is a connected graph where nodes sit on a rectangular grid. So, for a start, one could describe the nodes as a set of coordinate pairs:</p>

<pre><code>// just an example, this is not the actual map
// it doesn't need to be variables, could be array of arrays, or dictionary
var A = (0,0);
var B = (1,0);
var C = (2,1);
var D = (4,2);
// etc.
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you could describe the edges as pairs of points:</p>

<pre><code>var edges = [(A,B), (A,D), (B,C), ...];
</code></pre>

<p>With these, you surely could calculate a good path from a list of points, and also the location and direction of each node.</p>

<p>I'm not sure at all if this is the most efficient data structure, but it is already a start. You only need to know the location of each node, and the edges are defined simply by linking two nodes together.</p>

2306,32027233,How to multithread/multiprocess just one instance of a particular function in Python?,|python|multithreading|multiprocessing|robotics|,"<p>I'm running a Python script that controls a robot, but I'm a bit confounded as to how to multithread the motor control function.</p>

<p>The issue is that the hardware is designed such that the motors won't move unless there are several sleeps in the motor-control function, because the hardware requires time to send the electrical signals to the motors. Because of these sleeps in the motor-control function, the entire program halts and stops reading in sensor data.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is know how to multithread/multiprocess the motor-control function once it is called, but once the program hits the call again in the following iteration of the loop, it checks if the motor-control is still running (i.e. it isn't done with the sleep). If it is still running, it simply skips over the motor-control call and continues on with looping, reading sensor data, and then checking again if the motor-control function is still running. Of course, if the motor-control function is no longer running, I would like for it to once again be called.</p>

<p>Basically, the whole program only requires two threads: one that runs the main program, and one that branches off and continuously re-runs one instance of the motor-control function every time the motor-control function has completed its execution.</p>

<p>I know about <strong>EKF-SLAM</strong>, which uses a state from previous time to estimate next state as an online filter, 
I also know about <strong>Graph-SLAM</strong>, which uses all states in past as full SLAM, and represents them as merely whole bunch of nodes and edges, and optimize structure of nodes and eges by minimizing error to estimate better states.</p>

<p>Now,
I know that there is no meaning in running EKF-SLAM with odometry info only, since what EKF does is estimating future state by balancing weight between Odometry info AND Observation of landmark info. so both are needed.</p>

<p>My question is, is it possible to run <strong>Graph-SLAM with only Odometry info</strong> and no landmark observation info whatsoever?
It seems like Graph-SLAM can run by gathering all Odometry info state upto current ones and converting them to nodes and edges  just like it does when both Odo and obs are provided, and it can optimize the structure of nodes and edges.
Is is possible?
What does output mean? ""Optimized"" Odometry?
Any thought to it?

This year we plan on doing some vision processing/tracking to automatically find the goal and align ourselves with the goal.  We use java to program our robot and are apart of the FRC (First Robotics Competition).  We're having some trouble with the standard way of getting vision tracking to work, using RoboRealm, and I had a thought to use a Raspberry Pi as a co-processor solely for vision tracking purposes.  I've done a little bit of research as to what to use and it appears OpenCV is the best.  I have little experience in coding on the Raspberry Pi, but a basic understanding of python.  I was thinking of having the raspberry pi do all the tracking of the goal (has retro-reflective tape along the outer edge of the goal), and somehow sending that signal (through roborio -- on-board FRC standard processor) and to my java code, which will then tell our robot to either turn more left or more right depending on how far off from the target we are.  I'm just curious if this is in the realm of do-ability for a beginner programmer such as myself.  Any feedback would be great! </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

At this point you can do a simple thresholding like you said, if the COM is to the left, move left and vice versa.</p>

<p>The biggest issue would be reliably locating the goal, if you've never done CV before its easy to underestimate the difficulty of this task. My advice is to try to make the goal as apparent as possible. Since its reflective perhaps you can illuminate it to make it stand out more? Maybe shine IR(infra-red) from the robot and use an IR filter on the camera. You could also do this with any regular light in the visible spectrum. Once you've created adequate contrast between the goal and the background you could do simple <a href=""http://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html#gsc.tab=0"" rel=""nofollow"">thresholding</a> or possibly do <a href=""http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_template_matching/py_template_matching.html"" rel=""nofollow"">template matching</a> (though much slower, and it won't work if the goal is at an angle or skewed). </p>

<p>I hope I've given you some ideas, good luck.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br>
In your comment you mentioned your target is green which can simplify your problem. I'm not sure how much you know about CV, but images come in RGB format. Each pixel has a red, green, and blue component. If you are looking for green it might be nice to <a href=""http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_core/py_basic_ops/py_basic_ops.html#splitting-and-merging-image-channels"" rel=""nofollow"">split the colors</a> and only the green channel of the image for <a href=""http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_thresholding/py_thresholding.html#thresholding"" rel=""nofollow"">thresholding</a> THe open CV site has GREAT <a href=""http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorials</a> for getting started. I would highly recommend you (and anyone else on your team) take a look at this. I'd recommend you read:</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Gui Features in OpenCV<br>
a. Images<br>
b. videos</li>
<li>Core operations - Basic Operations on Images</li>
<li>Image Processing (this is the big one)<br>
c. Image Thresholding<br>
d. Smoothing (almost every image in every cv algorithm is smooth during pre processing)<br>
e. Morphological Transformations (may help clean the image after thresholding)<br>
i. Contours (this is where you get coordinates)  </li>
</ol>

<p>another tip is during algorithm development work with still images. Take a few different images of your goal from a perspective the robot would likely encounter. Do all your testing and development on those. Once you have a high confidence level then move to video. Even then I would start with <em>offline</em>
 video (a recording you capture, not real time). If you find issues its easy to reproduce them (just go back to that troublesome time-stamp in the vid and tweak your algorithm). Then finally do it with <em>online</em> (real-time) video.</p>

<p>Last piece of advice, even if your ultimate goal is to run on the RPi feel free to test your CV algorithm on any computer you have. If you use a laptop most of the time, throw opencv on that, the main difference in porting to Rpi will be the way you address the RPi camera module. But if you are still at early stages using stills and offline video this won't make a difference.

<p>PS. I used the <code>write</code> function instead of the writeMicroseconds because you can <code>read</code> the value you wrote. If you really need to use <code>writeMicroseconds</code> (which is pretty useless in my opinion, since servo precision is less than 1°, so <code>write</code> is more than sufficient) just store the target as a <code>uint16_t</code> and store also the last set value (and use that instead of the <code>read</code> function)</p>

The second servo moves 0-180 (clockwise). </p>

    double L3 = difference.Length;
    if (L3 &gt; 400) { L3 = 400; }
    if (L3 &lt; 170) { L3 = 170; }

<p>Initially, when the system is first started, the arm is straightened with shoulder=90, elbow =0.
When I give positive x values I get correct results in the left side of the canvas. However, I want the arm to move in the right side as well. I do not get correct values when I enter negatives. What am I doing wrong? Do I need an extra servo to reach points in the right side?</p>

However, it doesn't move in a straight line yet, when it should. I'm now studying which method should I implement to make the robot go straight. I pretty much understand how to use the encoders, but I'm not sure about the gyro. I had written a program for straight motion using encoder, but it's not moving straight exactly because of front brush speed, for further improvement I have decided to use gyro, If I use gyro possible to make straight motion ? or else any suggestion ?</p>
",7/29/2016 12:40,,1112,1,1,0,,,,,,38661450,"<p>First, make sure you conceptually understand what it means for a robot to drive in a straight line. You will not get a robot that moves perfectly in a straight line. You may get one to move straight-enough (perhaps more perfect than humans can determine) but there will always be error.</p>

<p>A gyroscope may not be able to determine you're going off course if it's gradual enough and depending on the quality of your gyro it may have a buildup of drift, causing it to think it's turning ever-so-slightly when it's sitting perfectly still. The more expensive of a gyro you get, the less this will be, but still.</p>

<p>Even if you assume perfect sensors, there is still a difference between ""driving straight"" and ""keeping on the straight and narrow"". Imagine you had coded a robot to drive such that it tried to keep its bearing as consistent as possible (drive straight). If, while it was moving you knocked it a bit, it would swerve to the side some and then correct itself to the original angle. However, it would be on a different path. Sure, the path would be parallel to the original one, but it would not be the same path.</p>

<p>Then there's the option of having it try to figure out just how far off the beaten path it was pushed and try to get back on it. That'll either take a constant reference (as a line follower robot would do) or more sensors (like a 3D gyro and 3D accelerometer).</p>

<p>That second option sounds a bit more than what you're doing, so here's the first option done in no particular robotics framework:</p>

<pre><code>//initialize
double angle = gyro.get_heading_degrees();
//...
//logic code that may be looped or fired by events
{
  //this is our error; how far off we are from our target heading
  double error = angle - gyro.get_heading_degrees() - 360;

  drive_system.drive_arcade(error / 180, 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes driving in an arcade fashion; you can adapt it to tank drive or swerve drive or mecanum drive or H-drive or...</p>

<p>The '1' is just a speed</p>

<p>The '-360' and '180' are values to reduce the angle to a value between -1 and 1. If your drive method uses a different range to determine angle, that'll have to be adapted.</p>

<p>Finally, this example isn't foolproof, but it should get you thinking about how to correct for errors when you've detected them.</p>

<pre><code>private static class InterruptSource extends DigitalSource {
    public InterruptSource(int channel) {
      initDigitalPort(channel, true);

<p>First is that the <code>InterruptSource</code> class has some unimplemented methods from the parent class. I just added empty definitions for these and that error obviously went away. Next is that the method <code>initDigitalPort</code> is not defined from the parent class. This is the part that I get stuck on. </p>

<p>My question is, what is the replacement method for initDigitalPort? </p>

<p>Forgive me for anything simple I've overlooked, we are a new FRC team so we have 0 experience with using wpilibj. </p>

<p>I believe a help would be to take advantage of the spline array index as a navigaion dimension    </p>

<p>with no initial info, a crude but not that slow startup step would be to simply find the min distance to the whole spline x, y trace, <code>out</code> - many SE ans for finding closest</p>

<p>then use that point's index as a state variable, and along with direction (increasing or decreasing <code>out</code> index) find the next index you want to head for</p>

<p>if you have started up, are close, and know your last index position (or estimated target point's index), then you could just search for ""closest"" in a slice near (in whatever is the current ""forward"" direction) your internal state index, updating your internal out index as you step...</p>

Arduino on the other hand can handle both analog and digital I/O, but it has very low processing power. Generally people use both of them together. You will also need motor drivers, battery management circuit etc. Coming to the code, it should have two parts: one that processes your voice and understands the command, one that takes the command and tells the robot what to do.

2663,42080006,Avoiding cycles in an directed graph efficiently,|algorithm|graph|robotics|graph-traversal|,"<p>I am trying to implement an algorithm called the 'rapidly exploring random belief tree'. The aim of this algorithm is to come up with a path for a robot, which, instead of connecting start and goal with a least distance metric or something similar, drives the robot into areas where it can get high accuracy measurements, and only then moves to the goal. </p>

<p>In the implementation of the algorithm, I start off by building a graph through random sampling of a given space. Every time a new point is sampled, a new edge is added to the graph. Initially, the error in the position of the robot will be high, as it won't be getting good measurements, but once the tree I am exploring through reaches the 'good' area, the robot's error suddenly drops, and with this knowledge of where the 'good' area is, I traverse backwards through the graph, pruning previously connected edges and connecting those vertices towards the good area. Given enough samples, in an optimal scenario, the graph would be propagating outward from the good area, hence connecting any two vertices would guarantee that you would pass through these points.  </p>

<p>Here's where I have a problem. Once I start the traversal to prune and update my edges, the algorithm shouldn't prune the edges that connect the good area to the starting point, which would result in an infinite loop. An example is shown in this picture:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JQgJ2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JQgJ2.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The algorithm finds vertices 1, 2, 3 and 4. The connections are 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 2 -> 4. </p></li>
<li><p>Now we find #5, which is a 'good' area for the robot. Visiting this vertex will magically enhance its accuracy in the future. I find neighboring vertices from 5: I find #3. I update the parent of #3 to #5 instead of #2. Now if there were more vertices surrounding #3, I would traverse those too, and update their parents to #3 etc., thus creating a path from #5 to all of those. (For more information, the traversal essentially computes the covariance of the robot if it were to move from #5 to #3 and whether that's more desirable than moving from #2 to #3). </p></li>
<li>But in no circumstances should I update the parent of #2 to #3: because the only way the robot got to #5 in the first place was through #2.</li>
</ol>

<p>To avoid this, a simple (but highly inefficient?) thing I did was to compute the shortest path to the vertex from where I began my traversal, and if any vertex I come across during traversal is part of this path, I don't update its parent. This works reasonably well, at the expense of a lot of computational cost because I need to do this every time I have to traverse backwards with an update, so I was wondering if there was a better, efficient way of doing this. </p>

I do understand that there are a handful of libraries like RL (Robotics Library) and ROS with inverse kinematics solvers. But for my dismay, these libraries DO NOT support MacOS platform. I have already written the Forward Kinematics part, which was quite straight forward. But for the Inverse Kinematics part, I am quite skeptical since the solution to a IK problem involves solving sets of non-linear simultaneous equation. I found out the Eigen/Unsupported 3.3 module has a APIs to non-linear equations. But before I begin on this uncertain path, I want to get some insight from you guys on the plausibility and practicality of writing my IK library. My manipulator design is rather simple with 4 DoF and the library will not be used for other designs of manipulators. So what I am trying to achieve is taylor-made IK library for my particular manipulator design than a rather a 'Universal' library. </p>

<p>So,</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I simply trying to reinvent the wheel here by not exploring the already available libraries? If yes, please suggest examples of IK libraries for MacOS platform.</li>
<li>Has anyone written their own IK library? Is it a practical solution? Or is it rather complex problem which is not worth solving for a particular manipulator design?</li>
<li>Or should I just migrate all my project code (OpenCV) to a Linux environment and develop the code for IK in Linux using existing libraries?</li>

As you stated ""manipulator design is rather simple with 4 DoF"" in my opinion you can write a fairly small function/module and you will not require the complexity of a general purpose library.
I used Maple to assist with creating the inverse equations, you may want to look for an alternative <a href=""http://alternativeto.net/software/maple/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Alternative</a>
On the other hand, the libraries you mention ROS and RL may not support your Mac at the highest level, but at the low level it is just c++ code, there is no reason you cannot use the libraries on your Mac and only use the low level functions.</p>

But I couldn't understand how  RL and ES are different. Can anyone please explain?</p>
",11/14/2018 19:36,53348627,6077,3,0,12,0,9761439,,5/8/2018 22:25,67,53348627,"<p>To my understanding, I know of two main ones.</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Reinforcement learning uses the concept of one agent, and the agent learns by interacting with the environment in different ways.  In evolutionary algorithms, they usually start with many ""agents"" and only the ""strong ones survive"" (the agents with characteristics that yield the lowest loss).</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Reinforcement learning agent(s) learns both positive and negative actions, but evolutionary algorithms only learns the optimal, and the negative or suboptimal solution information are discarded and lost.  </p>

<p><strong><em>Example</em></strong></p>

<p>You want to build an algorithm to regulate the temperature in the room.</p>

<p>The room is 15 °C, and you want it to be 23 °C. </p>

<p>Using Reinforcement learning, the agent will try a bunch of different actions to increase and decrease the temperature.  Eventually, it learns that increasing the temperature yields a good reward.  But it also learns that reducing the temperature will yield a bad reward.</p>

<p>For evolutionary algorithms, it initiates with a bunch of random agents that all have a preprogrammed set of actions it is going to do.  Then the agents that has the ""increase temperature"" action survives, and moves onto the next generation.  Eventually, only agents that increase the temperature survive and are deemed the best solution.  However, the algorithm does not know what happens if you decrease the temperature.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> RL is usually one agent, trying different actions, and learning and remembering all info (positive or negative).  EM uses many agents that guess many actions, only the agents that have the optimal actions survive.  Basically a brute force way to solve a problem.</p>

3058,49612231,Collision avoidance system - image interpretation,|computer-vision|robotics|,"<p><br>
I am refining an algorithm for collision avoidance I wrote for an ASV using a monocular camera.<br></p>

<p>In order to have a simple yet effective system, the algorithm relies on edge detection using a <em>Canny</em> filter, after proper erosion/dilation to remove noise and shading spots.<br>
The final image is a black and white frame where, starting from the bottom, the first contour found and the upper part gets coloured in white while the rest is black: so black can be interpreted as ""free space"" whereas white as ""obstacle"".</p>

<p>The rover should use this reactive collision avoidance system to steer accordingly, avoiding close obstacles.</p>

<p>Now I am having some problems to decide how to actually find the way to go.</p>

<p>This is my approach so far.<br>
The frame is split in columns whose width is exactly 1° relative bearing, then columns are grouped in three super-columns (corresponding to the directions <em>turn left, go on, turn right</em>) and the robot steers on the direction where the most black space is found.</p>

<p>Do you have any other idea on how to find where to steer/proceed given the output of this algorithm? <br>Thank you</p>

3149,51063970,Python fast calculating and slow Serial writing : Multithread or Multiprocess,|python|multithreading|multiprocessing|robotics|,"<p>I have a robotics project, basically a path tracking problem.
In PC, a reference generation algorithm is implemented in Python3.65. The algorithm takes Indoor GPS data and use these continuously-updated data to calculate the reference path for a robot-car. Of course, the algorithm runs in a 
<strong><em>while True:
   ....</em></strong>
framework.
The algorithm can work well only if the sampling frequency is quite high, say 0.001s. 
However, the problem is that, after calculating the reference path, the path info needs to be written to Serial port of the PC, byte by byte, via Serial.write(). 
This serial.write() function is still a for loop. And this writing process is very slow (more than 0.02s for 16 bytes). If the for loop is included in the while True: framework, something like：</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>while True:
  Data = Ref_generation()
  Bytes_Full = Float_2_Bytes_List(Data)
  for ele in Bytes_Full:
    Serial.write(ele)  # VERY SLOW!!!
  sleep(0.001)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Then, the Data can not be calculated correctly since the cycle period is much longer than 0.001s. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, how can I separate the fast calculating algorithm from the slow serial.wtite()? I tried multithreads, but not works. </p>

<p>Anyhelp will be appreciated, thanks a lot!</p>

3152,51089252,Using serializing an object in python for use with an XBee,|python|serialization|deserialization|ros|robotics|,"<p>For a project I'm working on, I'm supposed to use XBee radio modules, which isn't super important, except that I have to read and write to their serial port in order to use them. I'm currently working with Python and ROS, so I'm attempting to send TransformStamped messages over the XBees.</p>

<p>My question is, unless I'm misunderstanding how Serial.read() and Serial.write() work, how can I tell how many bytes to read? I was planning on using Pickle to serialize the data into a string, and then sending that over the serial ports. Is there a better way that I've overlooked? Is there some sort of loop that would work to read data until the end of the pickled string is read?</p>
",6/28/2018 18:27,51144344,193,1,0,1,,7901933,"Denver, CO, United States",4/21/2017 14:11,15,51144344,"<p>The short answer is, serial.read() cannot tell you how many bytes to read. Either you have some prior knowledge as to how long the message is, or the data you send has some means of denoting the boundaries between messages. </p>

<p>Hint; knowing how long a message is is not enough, you also need to know whereabouts in the received byte stream a message has actually started. You don't know for sure that the bytes received are exactly aligned with the sent bytes: you may not have started the receiver before the transmitter, so they can be out of step. </p>

<p>With any serialisation one has to ask, is it self delimiting, or not? Google Protocol buffers are not. I don't think Pickle is either. ASN.1 BER is, at least to some extent. So is XML.</p>

<p>The point is that XBee modules are (assuming you're using the ones from Digi) just unreliable byte transports, so whatever you put through them has to be delimited in some way so that the receiving end knows when it has a complete message. Thus if you pickle or Google Protocol Buf your message, you need some other way of framing the serialised data so that the receiving end knows it has a complete message (i.e. it's seen the beginning <em>and</em> end). This can be as simple as some byte pattern (e.g. 0xffaaccee00112233) used to denote the end of one message and the beginning of the next, chosen so as to be unlikely to occur in the sent messages themselves. Your code at the receiving end would read and discard data until is saw that pattern, would then read subsequent data into a buffer until it saw that pattern again, and only then would it attempt to de-pickle / de-GPB the data back into an object. </p>

<p>With ASN.1 BER, the data stream itself incorporates effectively the same thing, saving you the effort. It uses tags, values and length fields to tell its decoders about the incoming data, and if the incoming data makes no sense to the decoder in comparison to the original schema, incorrectly framed data is easily ignored.</p>

<p>This kind of problem also exists on tcp sockets, though at least with those delivery is more or less guaranteed (the first bytes you receive are the first bytes sent). A Digimesh connection does not quite reach the same level of guaranteed delivery as a tcp socket, so something else is needed (like a framing byte pattern) for the receiving application to know that it is synchronised with the sender. </p>

3104,49842838,Multiple systems sharing resources on multiple SoC's,|raspberry-pi|mpi|distributed-computing|hpc|robotics|,"<p>I have some Raspberry Pi's from previous projects/learning and I would like to pool their resources to make a differential drive robot.</p>

<p>Two Pi's would have one camera each for a vision system, one connected to an Arduino to read analog sensors, one for driving motors, and the last pi is the ""control"" and hosting a user interface (web app).  Nothing really special here! But I would like to be able to share the resources of all the Pi's for improved performance...</p>

<p>My thoughts on sharing resources is one of two approaches:</p>

<p>1) Use distributed memcached as a RAM cluster and run each sub system on one CPU only to avoid data races.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2) Use a messaging layer to distribute processing on all CPU.</p>

<p>To avoid a lot of headache, I thought I could use MPI since it does a lot of heaving lifting when it comes to messaging. However I can't seem to find any examples of any robotics projcets using MPI.</p>

<p>It looks like MPI is <em>simplest</em> to design when it's for supervised learning, or genomics (same code and large data sets).</p>

<p>In my case, each sub system runs very different code from the other.  But for example, the vision system runs the same code on a stream of hundred/thousand images. So why not use MPI for the vision, and let the ""contorl"" schedule when its starts / stops.</p>

<p>Then use its output as input for the next system, which also runs the same code, so can be paralleled.</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a reason why MPI is not a common approach for things like
  this in Robotics? If so, why and what is a good alternative?</p>

<p>There's a CUDA-MPI for GPU's so maybe this approach is not too far fetched?</p>

<p><strong>The following steps have been completed:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Separating color boundaries with HSV and drawing bounding boxes. So I have the pixel x, y of the object.</p></li>

<li>How do I translate the coordinates on the image frame to the robot end-effector coordinates?</li>
<li>If I keep the camera on a fixed position. Does this mean I only have to do the calibration ones?</li>
</ol>

<p>******* <strong>edit:</strong> *******</p>

<p>I went for a different approach. I managed to solve the rotation and translation between two coordinate systems through SVD. But I made an error in thinking I could use pixel coordinates to translate from the camera coordinate system to that of the robot. I think you need to translate the u, v values first. </p>

<p><strong>How can I translate the pixel uv to world coordinates, so that I can use the code below to get translation and rotation to robot arm?</strong></p>

<p>I would also request you to keep in mind that I'm a beginner to programming, so please keep your answers simple.</p>

<p>This is just for some extra info:<br>
The Wallaby is a mini computer to which you would connect your sensors, motors, servos and cameras in order to control a robot for the Botball competition. Usually, one can connect to the Wallaby either via Wifi Direct or a cable and write programs on it directly through an online interface (not entirely sure of the word for it, but you just type in an IP address in your browser and it brings up an interface where you can make projects and code). All the code written in that interface saves directly onto the Wallaby. Here the default include statement is <code>#include &lt;kipr/botball.h&gt;</code>, so I'm assuming that <code>botball.h</code> (which is located on the Wallaby's storage) has all those 60 libraries consolidated in it. I got the include folder that I'm using from <a href=""https://github.com/kipr/libwallaby"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GitHub</a>. This link was provided to me by one of the Botball organisers. So the main point in me trying to download the library is so that I can write and successfully compile code even when I'm not connected to the Wallaby. Hope this provides some relevant context. </p>

I'm using a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu 18.04 to accomplish this. The program will never run on anything but Linux. I'm not too familiar with qt, but it seems like the common way to run a qt application is by returning </p>

<pre><code>int QApplication::exec()
</code></pre>

<p>in the main function. However, I need to run non-GUI-related code concurrently. For example, I need a callback to be executed every time my encoders change state. This callback has nothing to do with user input or the GUI. How can I make the main function receptive to the callback while it is running the qt application window at the same time?</p>

<p>The documentation says: </p>

<pre><code>To make your application perform idle processing, i.e., executing a special function whenever
there are no pending events, use a QTimer with 0 timeout. More advanced idle processing schemes 
can be achieved using processEvents().
</code></pre>

<p>I don't really understand how either of these methods are applicable to my situation. Should either of these schemes be used, or should I use another technique? A simple example would help me a lot.</p>

<p>Edit: I'm adding this due to the comments below:</p>

<p>I'd rather not sample in intervals, because it would most likely miss some changes in state completely. I'm reading the data output from an AM26C32 chip via input on my gpio pins of the Pi. Essentially, every change in state needs to execute a callback. Since there are 40,000 states per motor revolution, I cannot have periodic checks -- the callbacks need to be executed immediately. The encoders (sensors) are incremental and not absolute. Also, I'm using the pigpio library for gpio handling.</p>

<p>Edit 2: After a bit more reading, I think I'll need to use QThread with event loops. The Raspberry Pi 3B+ has 4 cores; if I run the GUI on one thread, and each (of 2) encoder on another thread, this may work. Does anyone have experience with this? Am I on the right track here?</p>

<p>As callback in qt application thread => Execution blocked by GUI events</p>

<p>In background thread => Mostly free from interruption from GUI events, as you can have control on the priority.

<p>IMO handling in a background thread is a better options. Even if you are using Qt you can still use other threading / timer implementation.</p>

<p>The Frequency Counter 1 example from pigpio is still applicable</p>

<p>If you need communication between the callbacks and GUI, you can use a wait-free queue (e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/Taymindis/wfqueue"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/Taymindis/wfqueue</a> ) to pass message between them, while not being blocked by the progress of GUI thread</p>

If you have to read data periodically it might be sufficient but two additional requirements have to be matched: 1) Reading may not block. 2) Reading may not last too long.

  Which prepackaged software (a.k.a. 'osdeps') should autoproj install automatically (all, none or a comma-separated list of: os gem pip) ?
    The software packages that autoproj will have to build may require other
    prepackaged softwares (a.k.a. OS dependencies) to be installed (RubyGems
    packages, packages from your operating system/distribution, ...). Autoproj
    is able to install those automatically for you.
    
    Advanced users may want to control this behaviour. Additionally, the
    installation of some packages require administration rights, which you may
    not have. This option is meant to allow you to control autoproj's behaviour
    while handling OS dependencies.
    
    * if you say &quot;all&quot;, it will install all packages automatically.
      This requires root access thru 'sudo'
    * if you say &quot;pip&quot;, only the Python packages will be installed.
      Installing these packages does not require root access.
    * if you say &quot;gem&quot;, only the Ruby packages will be installed.
      Installing these packages does not require root access.
    * if you say &quot;os&quot;, only the OS-provided packages will be installed.
      Installing these packages requires root access.
    * if you say &quot;none&quot;, autoproj will not do anything related to the
      OS dependencies.
    
    Finally, you can provide a comma-separated list of pip gem and os.
    
    As any configuration value, the mode can be changed anytime by calling
      autoproj reconfigure
    
    Finally, the &quot;autoproj osdeps&quot; command will give you the necessary information
    about the OS packages that you will need to install manually.
    
    So, what do you want ? (all, none or a comma-separated list of: os gem pip) [all] 
  Would you like autoproj to keep apt packages up-to-date? [yes]

3707,61838032,Coordinate axis transformation for robot manipulation,|python|linear-algebra|ros|robotics|coordinate-transformation|,"<p>This is a fairly generic robotics based Linear Algebra question, and I'm looking for an algorithm based mathematical approach to solve my problem and get an understanding, rather than a strictly ROS based answer.</p>

<p>I am trying out a custom picking of an object using a Robotic Arm. I have a separate perception module that detects objects and estimates the pose for grasping. It, however is in the camera frame and follows image processing convention of coordinate frames, i.e. with right: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>+x-axis, forward: +z-axis, down: +y-axis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this perception module, I get two values - 3x3 Rotation matrix and 1x3 translation vector. 
As an example, say <code>T1</code></p>

<pre><code>Tra: [0.09014122 0.16243269 0.6211668 ]
Rot: [[ 0.          0.03210089 -0.99948463]
[ 0.          0.99948463  0.03210089]
[ 1.         -0.          0.        ]]
</code></pre>

<p>(i.e. I have to grasp at that location and in that orientation)
My robot base to camera transform is understandably in the right hand coordinate system. Here is an example of the same, say <code>T2</code></p>

<pre><code>translation: 
  x: 0.0564581200121
  y: 0.318823912978
  z: 0.452250135698
rotation: 
  x: -0.6954818376
  y: 0.693982204231
  z: -0.13156524004
  w: 0.13184954074
</code></pre>

<p>I am using <code>scipy.spatial.transform</code> to convert my poses from one format to another, so the actual implementation can handle any format of pose.</p>

<p>Now, to get the pose of the object from the robot, is a simple transformation T2 times T1. However, T1 follows a different convention from T2.</p>

<p>How would I go about this ? A detailed explanation using this example will be highly appreciated! I am trying to understand from scratch, hence I would prefer to arrive at a transformation matrix on my own to apply to the above ones to get the final pose.</p>

<p>This question probably belongs to Mathematics Stack Exchange and ROS as well, but as I mentioned, I am trying to approach it analytically.</p>

I have to create robot functionality for a customer, where the robot arm moves in between several objects to reach a given pose goal for its end-effector (gripper). </p>

<p>I have to use the MoveIt interface for motion planning. This interface can also compute Cartesian paths. If I understand correctly, cartesian paths are just a colletion of waypoint poses that the end-effector should reach sequentially.</p>

<p>My first question is, what is the advantage/disadvantage of executing a cartesian path, rather than moving to several waypoints manually one by one? </p>

<p>My second question is, would a motion planner first plan <strong>all</strong> the waypoints and then start executing them them one by one. Or will a motion planner repeatedly plan and execute for each waypoint in the cartesian path? </p>

<p>The reason that I would like to know this is because I think that moving the end-effector in steps (or waypoints) would improve the chances of finding a trajectory for a goal that is very difficult to reach due to many objects being in the environment. </p>

<p>I have included only the necessary part of the code here for brevity.</p>
<p><strong>Code Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>SimulationBridge class communicates with the robot in the simulation. It takes in vectorNavData and stores it in the member variable _vectorNavData. SimulationBridge also contains the pointer to the RobotRunner class as one of it's member. I am allocating the address of _vectorNavData object to the pointer _robotRunner-&gt;vectorNavData (check SimulationBridge.cpp). Inside the RobotRunner class I deference this pointer and use the values in other parts of the code.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>If I print the vectorNavData inside the SimulationBridge.cpp the values seems to be normal. But after assigning the pointer of the same object to the robot runner, if I print the values there the values seems to be abnormally high. My question is, is this way of using pointers for dynamic allocation recommended? If not what is the best alternative way I can use?</p>
<p>Another important point to note is, I am compiling the code with CMake and &quot;-O3&quot; optimization flag is set to the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS. If I remove this flag, the code sorta works fine for the above object pointer but I am still getting similar error for another object pointer in another part of the code.  I have not included that here because it's pretty complex to describe the code structure and the problem essentially is the same.</p>

I am trying to program it to move to a point and reach that point at a given angle, all while moving in a straight line. So far I've gotten the robot to reach that point, I've gotten it to stay on the straight line, but I cant get it to reach the correct angle(without having it turn and then move). To simplify the movement, I have a function that I creatively called Move, Move takes in three floats:</p>
<p>The first is what angle the robot moves to relative to the robots angle, but ignore this one as I got it working</p>
<p>the second(angle%) determines the percentage of motion that is given to the angular motion, so when it is given 1, the robot will only be turning, and when it is given 0, it won't turn at all. At 0.5 it will be turning a bit, and moving towards the destination at the same time.</p>
<p>The last one is the speed the robot moves at ranging from 0-127. For this I will probably use two PID loops, one for the angle error, and one for the distance error, then add both up.</p>
<p>So my problem is finding an algorithm to find what I should set angle% to, in order to arrive at a point facing the right way. There are a few 'properties that angle% must have: if distance = 0, and angle error &gt; 0, angle% should = 1. And if distance &gt; 0 and angle error = 0. Also when the angle err is 180deg, angle % should = 1.</p>
<p>I know the solution is going to be really simple but I can't wrap my head around this one.</p>

This schema has some limitations to it, which sometimes calls for clever tricks to get by any issues - but more on that in a minute.</p>
<p>First off, about the parameters themseleves.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li><code>d</code> is the distance between two frames <strong>i</strong> and <strong>(i-1)</strong> along the <strong>z</strong> axis of <strong>(i-1)</strong>.</li>
<li><code>a</code> - or <code>r</code> in your case - is the distance between two frames <strong>i</strong> and <strong>(i-1)</strong> along the <strong>x</strong> axis of <strong>i</strong>.</li>
<li><code>theta</code> is the angle between the <strong>x</strong> axes of <strong>i</strong> and <strong>(i-1)</strong> about the positive <strong>z</strong> axis of the <strong>(i-1)</strong> frame</li>
<li><code>alpha</code> is the angle between the <strong>z</strong> axes about the newly rotated x axis <strong>after</strong> the rotation of <code>theta</code> has been applied</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, DH notation presupposes the following about the axes of the coordinate frames:</p>
<ul>
<li>the z-axis always points along the axis of actuation (that is, rotation in your case).</li>
<li>the x-axis of the frame <strong>i</strong> has to intersect the z-axis of the frame <strong>(i-1)</strong></li>
<li>the y-axis is set such that the frame forms a right-hand coordinate system</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an image of your system in the home pose with coordinate frames applied according to DH notation.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J2ts0.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J2ts0.png"" alt=""home pose kinematic chain"" /></a></p>
<p>As you might notice, DH Notation does not allow for a displacement between the rotation and torison joint frames. This is not a problem, since mathematically it does not make a difference on where the rotation occurrs. The curved lines denote that the relevant frames are placed in the same position for notation purposes.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/loXDv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/loXDv.png"" alt=""table snapshot"" /></a></p>
<p>Now the only thing you have to do is think about where the rotations of your joints might be inserted into the DH-table as well as the displacement beteween the rotational frames (l1 through 4).</p>
<p>You may then insert the DH Parameters into the DH Matrix for each frame and use these transformations for your kinematic calculations.</p>
<p>For future questions, you might want to think about posting them at the <a href=""https://robotics.stackexchange.com/"">Robotics Stack Exchange</a> site, it will probably be easier to get an answer there very quick.</p>

3990,66786292,multiprocessing - blanket process termination,|python|python-multiprocessing|robotics|terminate|kill-process|,"<p>I'm building a GUI to control a robot in Python.
The GUI has a few buttons, each one executes a function that loops indefinitely.
It's like a roomba, where the &quot;clean kitchen&quot; function makes it continually clean until interrupted.</p>
<p>In order to keep the GUI interactive, I'm executing the function in a separate process using multiprocessing.</p>
<p>I've got a stop function that I call that returns the robot to home, and kills the child process (otherwise the child process would reach the next line, and the robot would start turning around when it's left the kitchen and gone home). The stop function runs in the main/parent process as it doesn't loop.</p>
<p>I've got a GUI button which calls Stop, and I'll also call it whenever I start a new process.</p>
<p>My processes are started like this:</p>
<pre><code>from file1 import kitchen
from file2 import bedroom

    if event == &quot;Clean kitchen&quot;:
       stoptour()
       p = multiprocessing.Process(target=kitchen,args=(s,),daemon=True)
       p.start()

    if event == &quot;Clean bedroom&quot;:
       stoptour()
       p = multiprocessing.Process(target=bedroom,args=(s,),daemon=True)
       p.start()
</code></pre>
<p>The argument being passed is just the socket that the script is using to connect to the robot.
My stop function is:</p>
<pre><code>def stoptour():
   p.terminate()
   p.kill()
   s.send(bytes.fromhex(XXXX)) #command to send the stop signal to the robot
   p.join()
</code></pre>
<p>This all runs without error and the robot stops, but then starts up again (because the child process is still running). I confirmed this by adding to the stop function:</p>
<pre><code>if p.is_alive:
        print('Error, still not dead')
    else:
        print('Success, its dead')
</code></pre>
<p>Every time it prints &quot;Error, still not dead&quot;...
Why are p.kill and p.terminate not working? Is something spawning more child processes?
Is there a way to write my <code>stoptour()</code> function so that it kills any and all child processes completely indiscriminately?</p>

Note that the robot model I use is an industrial one manufactured by ABB, and the 3d coordinate I sent already been converted to Robot Coordinate System.</p>
<p>Put aside the problem of coordinate, I solved it using Stereo Cameras. However, I found the pose problem to be so difficult, especially when convert the pose of AruCo marker w.r.t camera to the robot coordinate system. The images below represent the two-coordinate system, one for camera and one for the robot.</p>

    rmat = cv2.Rodrigues(rvec)[0]
    P = np.concatenate((rmat, np.reshape(tvec, (rmat.shape[0], 1))), axis=1)
    euler = -cv2.decomposeProjectionMatrix(P)[6]
    eul = euler_angles_radians

    pitch = eul[0, 0]
    roll = eul[2, 0]
    return (pitch, yaw, roll)

<p>The result are three angles that represent pose of the marker. Pitch represents the rotation when the marker rotate around X axis (camera), Yaw for the Y axis (camera) and Roll for the Z axis (camera as well.)
So, how I can convert these three angles to the robot coordinate system?</p>

3959,65888385,How does a vision guided robot arm approach a target object to pick up and drop it off at a target location?,|python|opencv|computer-vision|robotics|,"<p>I have a work project currently where my company is using a 3D printer, a couple of servo motors, and a raspberry pi to produce a robotic arm. This robotic arm is meant to be visually-guided. I am task to research and code the software for the robot to be able to pick up a specific object and place it at a specific location. I need some help on how I could program the robot to pick up the object using visual guidance.</p>
<p>I've made a set-up where the top-down image will very likely look like the picture below. The objective is to pick up a die (those that you can find in a casino or in a game of monopoly) inside a clearly marked area of operation and place it on a piece of paper with an 'X' marked on it.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rXzt8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rXzt8.jpg"" alt=""robotic-arm-sandbox"" /></a></p>
<p>This is what I've accomplished thus far:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am able to use OpenCV and Machine Learning to identify the die and the paper marked with 'X' and extract the coordinates in the image where the die is located (right now my camera is not located directly above the area of operations)</li>
<li>I am able to determine the orientation of the die (i.e. 30 degrees clockwise, 42 degrees anti-clockwise, etc) - this is important because the robotic arm uses a caliper-like clipper to pick up the die and I would not want it to hold the die insecurely by the corner</li>
<li>I am also able to code a program to move the robotic arm (something like servo1 to turn 30 degrees clockwise, servo2 to turn 40 degrees anti-clockwise, etc)</li>
</ol>
<p>However, I have no idea how I could code the robotic arm to pick up the die. The die and the X in the photo are for illustration purposes only, their location could change to any spot inside the area of operation.</p>
<p>What is really depressing is I can't come up with any strategy. Hopefully, someone can advise on some principles and recommend some strategies - I'm not asking for code because I am confident to code my own software. I also don't think the programming language is important at this point but if it helps, I am using Python for this project - are there any libraries for such a task already? I felt like I have searched the entire web but haven't found any helpful tutorials on this yet.</p>
<p>Also, if it's helpful - I come from a web-software developer background usually coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Python was the first language I've managed to master to a competent degree before I started coding with web technologies. I have some experience in C during my high school but have not coded in C for more than 10 years already.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

The local consistency of the landmarks in each sequential operation means that their positions relative to the robot and the positions among themselves correspond to reality.</p>
<p>The map fragments created at each step are combined to form a meaningful global map. In the meantime, the landmarks determined in the previous step can also take place in the next step. During this merge, if the locations of the landmarks are very different from each other on both local maps, local maps cannot be combined and mapping cannot be made because there will be no consistency.</p>
<p>Consistency of both the local and global map is critical, especially in loop closure studies. If the map you created is not consistent, you cannot detect loop closure.</p>

I want to get as accurate of a relative yaw angle reading as possible, avoiding or minimizing any gyro drift. I tried a simple approach of:</p>
<p>a) calculate the gyro angular rate zero-offset by computing the average gyro angular rate reading for a few seconds while my platform is known to be stationary.</p>
<p>b) read the angular rate while the LSM6DS3 reports a new reading is available (so, this should essentially be the output data rate I configured, i.e. 416Hz). I subtract this from the zero-offset calculated in (a) above to get the degrees/s angular rate and then integrate (multiply the time delta with the degrees/s angular rate and add to the current yaw angle).</p>
<p>Is this the best I can do to avoid gyro drift issues if I want to get as accurate of a relative yaw rating possible?</p>
<p>I looked a little bit at Kalman filters and Madgwick filters and Mahony filters but they don't seem to suggest the ability to improve yaw angle readings as it seems the accelerometer would not be useful to calculate the yaw angle? Is that correct?</p>

I am trying to control a robot using a template-based controller class written in c++. Essentially I have a UDP connection setup with the robot to receive the state of the robot and send new torque commands to the robot. I receive new observations at a higher frequency (say 2000Hz) and my controller takes about 1ms (1000Hz) to calculate new torque commands to send to the robot. The problem I am facing is that I don't want my main code to wait to send the old torque commands while my controller is still calculating new commands to send. From what I understand I can use Ubuntu with RT-Linux kernel, multi-thread the code so that my getTorques() method runs in a different thread, set priorities for the process, and use mutexes and locks to avoid data race between the 2 threads, but I was hoping to learn what the best strategies to write hard-realtime code for such a problem are.</p>

<p>Based on that, you're apparently going to have to discard roughly half the inputs, or else somehow (in a way that makes sense for your application) quickly combine the inputs that have arrived since the last time you processed the inputs.</p>
<p>But as the code is structured right now, you're going to fetch and process older and older inputs, so even though you're producing outputs at ~1 KHz, those outputs are constantly being based on older and older data.</p>
<p>For the moment, let's assume you want to receive inputs as fast as you can, and when you're ready to do so, you process the most recent input you've received, produce an output based on that input, and repeat.</p>
<p>In that case, you'd probably end up with something on this general order (using C++ threads and atomics for the moment):</p>

    auto u = get_torques(input);
    send_newCommands(u);

</code></pre>
<p>I've assumed that you'll always receive input faster than you can consume it, so the processing thread can always process whatever input is waiting, without receiving anything to indicate that the input has been updated since it was last processed. If that's wrong, things get a little more complex, but I'm not going to try to deal with that right now, since it sounds like it's unnecessary.</p>
<p>As far as the code itself goes, the only thing that may not be obvious is that instead of passing a reference to <code>new_input</code> to either of the existing functions, I've read new_input into variable local to the thread, then passed a reference to that.</p>

4316,72090152,Optimizing algorithm for a robot picking order,|algorithm|optimization|robotics|plc|,"<p>I'm trying to optimize a pick and place problem based on the previous robot positions.
Let's assume that all the positions, which represents working stations, are numbered from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>5</strong> and there's a SCARA robot between them. Every position does need some <strong>fixed</strong> time to process that piece and the piece must go to all stations before we can call it done . A PLC controls all of this process so it knows when a piece is ready somewhere inside one of these stations and sends the robot there to pick it. <br> <br> It is also important to know that stations <strong>2,3,4</strong> do the same process so a part must go either to station <strong>2, 3</strong> or <strong>4</strong> and then to station <strong>5</strong>. So the first part comes to position <strong>0</strong> (position <strong>0</strong> generates parts), the robot picks that part and places it to position <strong>1</strong>. After a fixed time the robot takes that part and moves it to station <strong>2</strong>. Now the position <strong>1</strong> is empty so the robot takes a part from position <strong>0</strong> and puts it into position <strong>1</strong>. Every movement of the robot takes a small time but not 0, which affects the whole process cycle time. <br> I'm trying to include that robot movement time into the parts processing time so when a piece is ready inside a station, the robot should be right there ready to pick it and place it somewhere else.<br><br>
A real experiment based on 5 stations numbered 0 to 5 gives the following order of the positions:<br />
<br> <br> <code>0-1, 1-2, 0-1, 2-5, 1-2, 0-1, 1-3, 0-1, 2-5, 1-2, 0-1, 1-3</code> ...
<br>
<BR>
The positions can be grouped because once a part is picked (the digit before '-') i know where it will be placed (the digit after) .

<p>Since the time of your process in each station is fixed, I'm thinking of using 5 or 6 separate timers, one for each station. Once the robot leaves the part in place you could start the specific timer for that station. When the robot is idle, it consults the remaining time of each one and goes to the one with the shortest time to complete.</p>
<p>This could be improved if you have a way to calculate (or look up in a list) the travel time from the current point to the station that is about to end... for example, the robot is at station 0 and station 1 is at 1.0 s from finishing and station 5 is 0.99999s from finishing... it would probably be more efficient to go to position 1 (closer) instead of going to position 5 (far).</p>
<p>Obviously this won't work if you don't know how long the part will take to be available at one of the stations, but in that case if you use a buffer to calculate the average waiting time of a part at a station (in which case you would have a sensor or something to check), you could estimate that the part is about to be ready using timers as well.</p>

4218,71122378,Reward Function for automated parking autonomous Robots,|python|reinforcement-learning|robotics|reward|,"<p>I'm implementing a reinforcement learning task, to solve a parking task for autonomous robots. So basically, the idea of the task is to start at a certain Point in front of the parking spot and drive to a pose without colliding with obstacles. The Agent has reached the goal if the a given Position and a Heading angle of the robot matches the goal pose.</p>
<p>I Have actually a lot of Problems shaping a Reward Function to solve this task. So I ask you guys, to help me with this. What I need a Reward Function depending on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(Distance reward)</strong>
The closer the robot is to the target, the higher the reward</li>
<li><strong>(Orientation reward)</strong> The smaller the tolerance of the heading angle to the angle of the target position, the higher the reward</li>
<li><strong>(Speed reward)</strong> The slower the speed when approaching the target position, the higher the reward</li>
</ul>
<p>My current Reward function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>    current_distance = self.get_euclidean_distance(current_position, desire_position)
    self.distance_reward = (-1)* current_distance/self.max_dist_to_targ

    # Heading Reward. 0: indicates vertical parking, -1: means reverse parking state
    heading_angle = abs(current_heading_angle - target_angle)
    if heading_angle &gt; 0 and heading_angle &lt; np.pi:
        self.heading_angle_reward = -1 * abs(heading_angle - np.pi/2) / np.pi
    else:
        self.heading_angle_reward = -2 * abs(heading_angle - (3*np.pi)/2) / (2*np.pi - 1)
        
    # Goal Reward
    self.goal_reward = 0
    if current_distance &lt;= cp.pose_tolerance and heading_angle &lt;= np.radians(cp.heading_angle_tolerance):
        self.goal_reward = 150

    # Collistion Penalty
    if not self.is_near_by_an_object2(beams_coords, current_trans_vel):
        self.collision_penalty = 0
    else:
        self.collision_penalty = -10

    reward = 10*((1 - w) * self.distance_reward + w * self.heading_angle_reward) +\
            10*self.goal_reward + 10* self.collision_penalty 
</code></pre>
<p>I would be very happy if someone can suggest me what is wrong with the function and how to implement the velocity reward!
Thank you guys.</p>

4341,72675794,Balance 2-wheeled robot without making it drift forward/backward,|c|matlab|controls|robotics|control-theory|,"<p>I'm trying to design a controller to balance a 2-wheels robot (around 13kg) and making it robust against external forces (e.g. if someone kicks it, it should not fall and not drift indefinitely forward/backward). I'm pretty experienced with most control techniques (LQR, Sliding Mode Control, PID etc), but I've seen online that most people use LQR for balancing 2-wheels robots, hence I'm going with LQR.</p>
<p>My problem is that, despite I'm able to make the robot not fall down, it rapidly starts going forward/backward indefinitely, and I don't how to make it mantain a certain position on the ground. What I want to achieve is that, when the robot gets kicked by an external force, it must be able to stop moving forward/backward while mantaining the balance (it's not necessary to mantain a position on the ground, I just want the robot to stop moving).
The measurements to which I have access from the sensors are: position on both wheels (x), velocity of both wheels (x_dot), angular position of robot (theta), angular velocity of robot (theta_dot).
Since now I tried 2 approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>set all reference signals to 0 and try to tune the LQR gain. With this (simple) approach I'm not sure if the coefficients of gain K relative to x and theta should have same or opposite sign, because, if for example the robot gets kicked away from its reference for x, the wheels should move in the direction that makes the robot return to the 0 point, but this would make theta go in the opposite direction. When the robot gets kicked, I would like that first theta gets adjusted in order to brake the movement given by the external force, and then x_dot should go in the same direction as theta in order to stop the robot.</li>
<li>use best LQR gains that I could find empirically/with MATLAB and use some &quot;heuristic&quot; in order to, given the current state of the robot (x, x_dot, theta, theta_dot), choose the reference signals for the state variables. I tried the heuristic &quot;if x_dot goes forward/backward, then make theta inclide backward/forward&quot;, which makes the robot avoid drifting forward/backward in case there're no disturbances, but if I kick the robot it starts oscillating really fast until it falls (I tried to adjust the K gain of LQR to solve this problem, but I couldn't find any that solved it).</li>
</ol>
<p>Which approach would you suggest me to use? Should I implement some more sophisticated heuristics (any suggestion?) or should I just tune the LQR gain until I find the perfect one? Should I consider using an integrator (for controlling which states?) together with the LQR?</p>

Since you did not give more details regarding the setup, let us assume you have a IMU aligned with the body frame and you have a method of computing roll, pitch and yaw of the robot at a given moment. Also let the speed at which u can compute RPY, is at least twice the speed of the main system loop.</p>
<p>You may want to start by designing three independent PID controllers, each for the three axis with 0 degrees being the target state that you want to maintain. Quite a while back, I was able to make my quadrotor self-balance by constraining two axes and tuning one at a time. In your case, you would first make the PID responsible for one of the axis be able to bring the robot to neutral position for a range of external disturbance that you expect the system to face during operation. A PID won't be able to respond fast enough if you had say tuned for say 5 - 10 N force kicks but later subjected to 100 N kick.</p>
<p>Give this a try and maybe furnish the question with details regarding the robot, the type of wheels u are using and so forth.</p>

<p>eg. if you want the motor to just move forward, the code would set the motors to both move forward - however, immediately afterwards, the code decides there is no left/right input so sets the motors to stop. This is so fast you don't see any movement in the motors.</p>

First i would like to point out that i am a beginner so it would be better for me if i can get simple lines of code that i can digest.</p>
<p>So, the project asks for:</p>
<p>A 10 by 10 grid, with the robot starting from the uppermost left position which is X(0,0).</p>
<p>Moving from X(0,0) down one tile will increase the value to (1,0) until (9,0) which is the downmost left corner, while moving from X(0,0) to the right will increase each time by (0,1) until (0,9) upper right corner. Moving from position (9,0) to the right will again be up to (9,9).</p>
<p>It will accept commands to move Up, down, left, right (u ,d ,l, r). Each command should be given together with and integer number that denotes the steps to the given direction (for ex. u5, or d2).</p>
<p>The user will give commands continuously until ENTER is pressed which will make the program exit.</p>
<p>After each command, the program must calculate the position of the robot and print out a message with it.</p>
<p>In the case that the user gives a command that cannot be executed or will make the robot go outside the grid, then an error message must appear. It must also give the error message in instances where X or Y =&gt; N.</p>

<p>So obviously some sensor data are not sent (or not received).
I tried with different intervals, but in any case it seems
that usens_l is receveid much more frequent than the other data.</p>
<p>There could be a more simple way to send the data synchronously
but building a string or calculate to a single value to integrate
the data and send at once. Maybe this is the solution for
my current issue. But I would like to understand, why this
communication does not work as expected.</p>

4564,75961498,Creating a Ros2 subscriber within a Nav2 Costmap Layer,|c++|robotics|ros2|,"<p>I am currently writing my own custom costmap plugin for use with the navigation2 stack. I'm trying to have the costmap layer take the navigation goal into account when updating costs near it. I've been trying to do this by adding a subscriber to the custom costmap layer that will pull the position of the navigation goal when it is set.</p>
<p>However, I haven't found a good way to do this.</p>
<p>I've tried to use the existing Lifecycle node within the nav2_costmap_2d::Layer class, but no matter what I do, I simply cannot get the data types to match. When I first tried to create the subscriber within the <code>onInitialize</code> method I wasn't able to build the plugin due to colcon complaining that it could not find the subscriber (error looked like this):</p>
<pre><code>error: no matching function for call to ‘std::function&lt;void(const geometry_msgs::msg::Pose2D_&lt;std::allocator&lt;void&gt; &gt;&amp;)&gt;::function(std::_Bind&lt;void (jackstand_objective_costmap_plugin::JSLayer::*(std::shared_ptr&lt;rclcpp_lifecycle::LifecycleNode&gt;, std::_Placeholder&lt;1&gt;))(const geometry_msgs::msg::Pose2D_&lt;std::allocator&lt;void&gt; &gt;&amp;)&gt;&amp;)’
  394 |       callback_variant_ = static_cast&lt;typename scbth::callback_type&gt;(callback);
</code></pre>
<p>I figured this was because the Lifecycle node needed to be in the process of being configured to create a subscriber. So the next thing I attempted to do was define an <code>on_configure</code> callback to the node within the Layer class. I attempted to do this via the <code>register_on_configure</code> method. I could not get my types to match though. When I made a <code>func</code> function the method always complained that it needed a type <code>std::function&lt;func&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I tried making a separate regular node that I could set as a shared pointer within my costmap layer which also didn't work. This was due to the plugin not even recognizing the node I had made within my code.</p>
<p>Is there a way to add a subscriber to a custom costmap layer plugin? If so, would anyone please tell me how?</p>

4581,76164592,DJI RS 2: Calculate Attitude from Joint Angles,|python|numpy|robotics|,"<p>At the moment I'm working on the DJI Ronin RS 2 gimbal. The configuration is shown in the image. (<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iwrme.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://i.stack.imgur.com/iwrme.png</a>) There is a camera mounted on the gimbal. The red arrows mark the axes of the gimbal. The joint angles alpha, beta and gamma are measured and therefore known. The green coordinate system is the fixed reference system.</p>
<p>So much for the setup. Now to the complicated part: How can I combine the angles alpha, beta and gamma to calculate one yaw angle (around green z-axis), one roll angle (around green x-axis) and one pitch angle (around green z-axis) in the reference system, to let me know where the camera is pointing to?</p>
<p>I know that I could also get the attitude-information directly from the gimbal by sending another &quot;obtain&quot;-command. However, I do need the joint angles and the attitude angles. Therefore I thought it would be easier to calculate the attitude angles from the joint angles.</p>
<p>Any help is highly appreciated! Thank you.</p>
<p>So far, I set up different rotation matrices (basic rotations around x-, y-, z-axis combined by multiplication) and tried to calculate the attitude with the following formulas:</p>

          [0, -np.sin(a), np.cos(a)]]
    Rx = np.round(Rx, decimals = 3)
    return Rx

def Ry(a):
    # Transformation to radiant
    a = np.radians(a)
    Ry = [[np.cos(a), 0, -np.sin(a)],
          [0, 1, 0],
          [np.sin(a), 0, np.cos(a)]]
    Ry = np.round(Ry, decimals = 3)
    return Ry

def Rz(a):
    # Transformation to radiant
    a = np.radians(a)
    Rz = [[np.cos(a), np.sin(a), 0],
          [-np.sin(a), np.cos(a), 0],
          [0, 0, 1]]
    Rz = np.round(Rz, decimals = 3)
    return Rz

# Rotation around z-axis
R10 = Rz(alpha)

# Rotation around y-axis
R21 = Ry(55)

# Rotation around x-axis
R32 = Rx(beta)

# Rotation around y-axis
R43 = Ry(gamma)

R20 = np.matmul(R21, R10)
R30 = np.matmul(R32, R20)
R = np.matmul (R43, R30)

pitch = -np.arcsin(R[2,0])
roll = np.arctan2(R[2,1]/np.cos(pitch), R[2,2]/np.cos(pitch))
yaw = np.arctan2(R[1,0]/np.cos(pitch), R[0,0]/np.cos(pitch))`
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this hasn't led to the right result yet. I guess that these formulas only apply to rotation around x-, y-, and z-axis in a certain order. This gimbal uses another rotation axis due to the joint in the middle.</p>

<li>cross-compile your module and have it loaded by NAOqi.

<p>The footage will be of vehicles captured from 3 different angles including its top view. I want to find whether the vehicle touches white lines drawn on the ground. I did it with OpenCV using background masking method. It worked for me. But then the shadow of the vehicle started causing problems as long shadows (during morning and evening hours) are detected as foreground crossing the white lines. So then I applied a shadow cancellation algorithm on it. but its too heavy and is causing too much delay so it wont work I real time.</p>
<p>I am planning to use deep learning to do the same now. I trained a resnet18 based model to do the task. but it is not generalizing and is getting overfit. So it is only able to detect those images I trained it. when I implement it, it started to show false results.</p>

Now I have a conveyor, on top of which I have placed a camera. I am using the image from that camera and passing it into the model for inference.The model outputs a result dictionary which contains labels, bbox coordinates, score. Since I have a continuous camera feed and objects are coming on the conveyor, I am getting multiple entries for the same object. Say if I have a can on the conveyor then I am getting atleast 10-15 entries till the can goes out of camera’s frame of view.
I want to save the unique detections in an array as I have to use that data further up in the pipeline.</p>
<p>I am at my wits end, I have tried using Bounding Box similarity as a factor to store unique detections, I have tried assigning unique ids to the detections, I have also tried using Bounding Box corner coordinates as a way to filter out unique detections. But all of that fails if I have say 2 cans simultaneously behind each other coming in on the conveyor, then the array only saves that as 1 detection and this messes up the further pipeline.
I would like to know if there is a better way to do this task or if I am doing something wrong. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>There is a line that sets both <code>name</code> and <code>exec</code></p>

4668,77153709,Executable in a non-ROS workspace links to an executable in a ROS workspace,|ubuntu|cmake|linker|ros|robotics|,"<p>I'm working in ubuntu 20.04 and have ROS noetic. I have a catkin workspace (catkin_ws), and it has DBow2 in it at <code>/home/glenn/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libDBoW2.so</code>. I also have the library <a href=""https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ORB-SLAM3</a> installed on my system. It uses DBoW2 and has it installed in its <code>Thirdparty</code> folder, so after building this package, its location is at <code>/home/glenn/ORB_SLAM3/Thirdparty/DBoW2/lib/libDBoW2.so</code>.</p>
<p>When I try to run any executable from ORB-SLAM3, for example, <code>./Monocular/mono_euroc ../Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./Monocular/EuRoC.yaml ~/Documents/Trial_Data/euroc/V1_01 ./Monocular/EuRoC_TimeStamps/V101.txt dataset-V101_mono</code>, it gives the following error:</p>
<p><code>./Monocular/mono_euroc: symbol lookup error: /home/glenn/ORB_SLAM3/lib/libORB_SLAM3.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5DBoW24FORB1LE</code></p>
<p>When I typed <code>ldd -r /home/glenn/ORB_SLAM3/lib/libORB_SLAM3.so</code>, I get a large output, but the relevant one to my issue is the following line:</p>
<p><code> libDBoW2.so =&gt; /home/glenn/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libDBoW2.so (0x00007fd840758000)</code></p>
<p>which shows it's pointing to the DBoW library from the catkin workspace and not the ORB_SLAM3 workspace. To get around this, I simply comment out <code>source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash</code> line in my bashrc and source it again, the same line from the same command gets the right output:</p>
<p><code>libDBoW2.so =&gt; /home/glenn/ORB_SLAM3/Thirdparty/DBoW2/lib/libDBoW2.so (0x00007f9136949000)</code></p>
<p>and everything in ORB_SLAM3 works fine again.</p>
<p>I just wanted to know if there was a better way to manage a shared library looking in the wrong place at runtime without having to constantly comment out the line to source my catkin workspace?

<pre><code>set(CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH FALSE)

set(CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH TRUE)

<p>but that gave significantly more errors for libORB_SLAM3.so. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<li>So I've tried to debug it by setting the input pixel to be (w/2, h/2). It results to the expected value of ray_directions_camera = near [0,0,1]</li>

<p>But somehow the rotation I get in the ray's direction in world frame is wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>I also plot the result, the transformation and rotation of the camera. So the translation and rotation must be right.</li>

4750,77923548,Multi layer abstraction design for physical liquid handlers,|architecture|robotics|,"<p>I am attempting to implement a solution for our robotic liquid handlers. The problem is that we have many different vendor liquid handlers in our company and even liquid handlers from the same company can differ. So I want to create a multi layer abstraction to simplify the programming. We cannot use open source projects hence why I need to do this internally. We have also not found any good open source options anyway.</p>
<p>As a high level overview:
You have a liquid handler that picks up tips and performs pipetting operations, this robot also has a plate arm that pickup and move plates around the pipetting deck. Nothing in the physical world is perfect so of course the liquid handler will occasionally run into errors. Also, even if the liquid handler is working perfectly user may incorrectly load something on the deck that could also cause an error. What I want to do is create a multi layer abstraction to help with programming but also to simplify error handling.</p>
<p>Per programming design I want to compose the layers in a way which is as decoupled as possible, and therein lies my problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>My driver layer is for raw command execution. Lots of low level errors can occur here.</li>
<li>My HAL layer is for simplified execution and the for the majority of error handling. Some errors will require user input (a UI dialogue or similar) and a retry (repeat the action or cleanup and then repeat).</li>
<li>My API layer will group HAL devices and commands together to create very complex behaviors.</li>
</ol>
<p>So my question is this: <strong>How can I design a system in such a way that I can handle the UI portion at such a low level without implementing UI components in the HAL or API layer?</strong> According to everything I have read the UI should be implemented in a UI layer or even dependency injection for even more flexibility.</p>
<p>I can add additional information as requested!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

I a using the KITTI dataset and specifically I am using the synced and rectified data. For simplification purposes i have chosen a feature that is detected only in the first and second camera frame. Since the rotation and translation of the camera poses are not given directly i have chosen to use the GPS/IMU rotation and translation matrices and use the relevant transformations to calculate the camera rotation and translation. acoording to equation (8) of the relevant papaer (<a href=""https://www.cvlibs.net/publications/Geiger2013IJRR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.cvlibs.net/publications/Geiger2013IJRR.pdf</a>) a 3D point in GPS IMU coordinates (current coordinate system of the GPS/IMU) is projected to a 2D point in the cameras frame as follows :
y = P_rect<em>R_rect</em>Tvelo_cam*Timu_velo, where P_rect is the projection matrix of the camera after rectification. R_rect is the rectifying rotation matrix , Tvelo_cam is the transformation from the velodyne's coordinate frame to the cameras frame and Timu_velo is the transformation from the IMU's coordinate frame to the velodyne's coordinate frame. Note that I have chosen the first pose of the IMU as the origin of my world coordinate frame, meaning at point (0,0,0) the IMU has not rotated or moved.</p>
<p>Assuming that X is computed with respect to the real world coordinate frame, the results dont make sense : Specifically X,Y,Z = array([-10.55149986,   4.61478588,   2.40134485]). By taking into account the configuration of the worlds coordinate frame (x axis forward, y axis left and z axis up) this means that the point was detected behind the IMU (X&lt;0), which is impossible because the IMU is behind the camera. I would appreciate any kind of help, since I am stuck a long time in this.</p>

I have been able to get a sort of code for the moving to X,Y and another function which returns it to the starting position(X=0,Y=0), but I haven't tested that yet as I need to figure something out to use pycharm to program the robot. The second problem with the code is that the area it needs to drive in is U shaped, and it cant hit the object in the middle as it is very expensive.</p>
<p>The code atm:</p>
<pre><code>import time
from dji_robomaster_sdk import RoboMaster
from dji_robomaster_sdk import robot
from dji_robomaster_sdk import armor
from dji_robomaster_sdk import chassis

# Initialize the robot
robo = RoboMaster()
robo.initialize()

# Define the starting position
starting_position = (0, 0)

# Define the U-shaped area
area_width = 100
area_height = 50

# Function to make the robot go back to the starting position
def go_to_starting_position():
    global starting_position
    chassis.move(0, 0, 0, 0).wait_for_completed()
    chassis.move(-starting_position[0], 0, 0, 0).wait_for_completed()
    chassis.move(0, 0, 0, 0).wait_for_completed()

# Function to check if the given coordinates are within the U-shaped area
def is_within_area(x, y):
    global area_width, area_height
    return -area_width / 2 &lt;= x &lt;= area_width / 2 and -area_height / 2 &lt;= y &lt;= area_height / 2

# Function to make the robot go to the given coordinates
def go_to_coordinates(x, y):
    global starting_position
    if not is_within_area(x, y):
        print(&quot;The given coordinates are outside the U-shaped area.&quot;)
        return
    if x &lt; 0:
        x = 0
    if y &lt; 0:
        y = 0
    if x &gt; area_width:
        x = area_width
    if y &gt; area_height:
        y = area_height
    chassis.move(x - starting_position[0], y - starting_position[1], 0, 0).wait_for_completed()
    starting_position = (x, y)

# Example usage
go_to_coordinates(50, 0)
time.sleep(2)
go_to_coordinates(0, 25)
time.sleep(2)
go_to_coordinates(-50, 0)
time.sleep(2)
go_to_coordinates(0, -25)
time.sleep(2)
go_to_starting_position()

# Shut down the robot
robo.close()

<p>I'm not a programmer so i dont even know if the above code is correct.
All help is apreciated!</p>

<ul>
<li>Discretize the space (break it up into a grid) and make some cells &quot;untraversable&quot; and use something like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A* (A Star)</a> to plan a shortest path through the grid cells. Then iteratively feed each grid cell location to your <code>go_to_coordinates</code> function.</li>
<li>Use a random sampling planner like RRT which generates a tree of randomly sampled points in a space to eventually reach a goal location without passing through obstacles (<a href=""https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics/tree/master/PathPlanning/RRT"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">open source RRT code</a>).</li>
<li>Use a <a href=""https://github.com/mbpeterson70/tomma/blob/main/examples/dubins_trajectory_opt.ipynb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trajectory optimization approach</a> to create a sequence of timestamped trajectory points to reach the goal while avoiding the obstacle in the middle.</li>
